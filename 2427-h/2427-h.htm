<h1>THE PATAGONIA<br />
by Henry James</h1>
<h2>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> houses were dark in the August
night and the perspective of Beacon Street, with its double chain
of lamps, was a foreshortened desert.&nbsp; The club on the hill
alone, from its semi-cylindrical front, projected a glow upon the
dusky vagueness of the Common, and as I passed it I heard in the
hot stillness the click of a pair of billiard-balls.&nbsp; As
&ldquo;every one&rdquo; was out of town perhaps the servants, in
the extravagance of their leisure, were profaning the
tables.&nbsp; The heat was insufferable and I thought with joy of
the morrow, of the deck of the steamer, the freshening breeze,
the sense of getting out to sea.&nbsp; I was even glad of what I
had learned in the afternoon at the office of the
company&mdash;that at the eleventh hour an old ship with a lower
standard of speed had been put on in place of the vessel in which
I had taken my passage.&nbsp; America was roasting, England might
very well be stuffy, and a slow passage (which at that season of
the year would probably also be a fine one) was a guarantee of
ten or twelve days of fresh air.</p>
<p>I strolled down the hill without meeting a creature, though I
could see through the palings of the Common that that recreative
expanse was peopled with dim forms.&nbsp; I remembered Mrs.
Nettlepoint&rsquo;s house&mdash;she lived in those days (they are
not so distant, but there have been changes) on the water-side, a
little way beyond the spot at which the Public Garden terminates;
and I reflected that like myself she would be spending the night
in Boston if it were true that, as had been mentioned to me a few
days before at Mount Desert, she was to embark on the morrow for
Liverpool.&nbsp; I presently saw this appearance confirmed by a
light above her door and in two or three of her windows, and I
determined to ask for her, having nothing to do till
bedtime.&nbsp; I had come out simply to pass an hour, leaving my
hotel to the blaze of its gas and the perspiration of its
porters; but it occurred to me that my old friend might very
<i>well</i> not know of the substitution of the <i>Patagonia</i>
for the <i>Scandinavia</i>, so that I should be doing her a
service to prepare her mind.&nbsp; Besides, I could offer to help
her, to look after her in the morning: lone women are grateful
for support in taking ship for far countries.</p>
<p>It came to me indeed as I stood on her door-step that as she
had a son she might not after all be so lone; yet I remembered at
the same time that Jasper Nettlepoint was not quite a young man
to lean upon, having&mdash;as I at least supposed&mdash;a life of
his own and tastes and habits which had long since diverted him
from the maternal side.&nbsp; If he did happen just now to be at
home my solicitude would of course seem officious; for in his
many wanderings&mdash;I believed he had roamed all over the
globe&mdash;he would certainly have learned how to manage.&nbsp;
None the less, in fine, I was very glad to show Mrs. Nettlepoint
I thought of her.&nbsp; With my long absence I had lost sight of
her; but I had liked her of old, she had been a good friend to my
sisters, and I had in regard to her that sense which is pleasant
to those who in general have gone astray or got detached, the
sense that she at least knew all about me.&nbsp; I could trust
her at any time to tell people I was respectable.&nbsp; Perhaps I
was conscious of how little I deserved this indulgence when it
came over me that I hadn&rsquo;t been near her for ages.&nbsp;
The measure of that neglect was given by my vagueness of mind
about Jasper.&nbsp; However, I really belonged nowadays to a
different generation; I was more the mother&rsquo;s contemporary
than the son&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint was at home: I found her in her back
drawing-room, where the wide windows opened to the water.&nbsp;
The room was dusky&mdash;it was too hot for lamps&mdash;and she
sat slowly moving her fan and looking out on the little arm of
the sea which is so pretty at night, reflecting the lights of
Cambridgeport and Charlestown.&nbsp; I supposed she was musing on
the loved ones she was to leave behind, her married daughters,
her grandchildren; but she struck a note more specifically
Bostonian as she said to me, pointing with her fan to the Back
Bay: &ldquo;I shall see nothing more charming than that over
there, you know!&rdquo;&nbsp; She made me very welcome, but her
son had told her about the <i>Patagonia</i>, for which she was
sorry, as this would mean a longer voyage.&nbsp; She was a poor
creature in any boat and mainly confined to her cabin even in
weather extravagantly termed fine&mdash;as if any weather could
be fine at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah then your son&rsquo;s going with you?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes, he&rsquo;ll tell you for himself much
better than I can pretend to.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jasper Nettlepoint at
that moment joined us, dressed in white flannel and carrying a
large fan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, my dear, have you decided?&rdquo;
his mother continued with no scant irony.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
hasn&rsquo;t yet made up his mind, and we sail at ten
o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter when my things are put up?&rdquo;
the young man said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no crowd at this
moment; there will be cabins to spare.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m waiting
for a telegram&mdash;that will settle it.&nbsp; I just walked up
to the club to see if it was come&mdash;they&rsquo;ll send it
there because they suppose this house unoccupied.&nbsp; Not yet,
but I shall go back in twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, how you rush about in this temperature!&rdquo;
the poor lady exclaimed while I reflected that it was perhaps
<i>his</i> billiard-balls I had heard ten minutes before.&nbsp; I
was sure he was fond of billiards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rush? not in the least.&nbsp; I take it uncommon
easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah I&rsquo;m bound to say you do!&rdquo; Mrs.
Nettlepoint returned with inconsequence.&nbsp; I guessed at a
certain tension between the pair and a want of consideration on
the young man&rsquo;s part, arising perhaps from
selfishness.&nbsp; His mother was nervous, in suspense, wanting
to be at rest as to whether she should have his company on the
voyage or be obliged to struggle alone.&nbsp; But as he stood
there smiling and slowly moving his fan he struck me somehow as a
person on whom this fact wouldn&rsquo;t sit too heavily.&nbsp; He
was of the type of those whom other people worry about, not of
those who worry about other people.&nbsp; Tall and strong, he had
a handsome face, with a round head and close-curling hair; the
whites of his eyes and the enamel of his teeth, under his brown
moustache, gleamed vaguely in the lights of the Back Bay.&nbsp; I
made out that he was sunburnt, as if he lived much in the open
air, and that he looked intelligent but also slightly brutal,
though not in a morose way.&nbsp; His brutality, if he had any,
was bright and finished.&nbsp; I had to tell him who I was, but
even then I saw how little he placed me and that my explanations
gave me in his mind no great identity or at any rate no great
importance.&nbsp; I foresaw that he would in intercourse make me
feel sometimes very young and sometimes very old, caring himself
but little which.&nbsp; He mentioned, as if to show our companion
that he might safely be left to his own devices, that he had once
started from London to Bombay at three quarters of an
hour&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it must have been pleasant for the people you
were with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the people I was with&mdash;!&rdquo; he returned;
and his tone appeared to signify that such people would always
have to come off as they could.&nbsp; He asked if there were no
cold drinks in the house, no lemonade, no iced syrups; in such
weather something of that sort ought always to be kept
going.&nbsp; When his mother remarked that surely at the club
they <i>were</i> kept going he went on: &ldquo;Oh yes, I had
various things there; but you know I&rsquo;ve walked down the
hill since.&nbsp; One should have something at either end.&nbsp;
May I ring and see?&rdquo;&nbsp; He rang while Mrs. Nettlepoint
observed that with the people they had in the house, an
establishment reduced naturally at such a moment to its simplest
expression&mdash;they were burning up candle-ends and there were
no luxuries&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t answer for the
service.&nbsp; The matter ended in her leaving the room in quest
of cordials with the female domestic who had arrived in response
to the bell and in whom Jasper&rsquo;s appeal aroused no visible
intelligence.</p>
<p>She remained away some time and I talked with her son, who was
sociable but desultory and kept moving over the place, always
with his fan, as if he were properly impatient.&nbsp; Sometimes
he seated himself an instant on the window-sill, and then I made
him out in fact thoroughly good-looking&mdash;a fine brown clean
young athlete.&nbsp; He failed to tell me on what special
contingency his decision depended; he only alluded familiarly to
an expected telegram, and I saw he was probably fond at no time
of the trouble of explanations.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s absence
was a sign that when it might be a question of gratifying him she
had grown used to spare no pains, and I fancied her rummaging in
some close storeroom, among old preserve-pots, while the dull
maid-servant held the candle awry.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether this same vision was in his own eyes; at all events it
didn&rsquo;t prevent his saying suddenly, as he looked at his
watch, that I must excuse him&mdash;he should have to go back to
the club.&nbsp; He would return in half an hour&mdash;or in
less.&nbsp; He walked away and I sat there alone, conscious, on
the dark dismantled simplified scene, in the deep silence that
rests on American towns during the hot season&mdash;there was now
and then a far cry or a plash in the water, and at intervals the
tinkle of the bells of the horse-cars on the long bridge, slow in
the suffocating night&mdash;of the strange influence, half-sweet,
half-sad, that abides in houses uninhabited or about to become
so, in places muffled and bereaved, where the unheeded sofas and
patient belittered tables seem (like the disconcerted dogs, to
whom everything is alike sinister) to recognise the eve of a
journey.</p>
<p>After a while I heard the sound of voices, of steps, the
rustle of dresses, and I looked round, supposing these things to
denote the return of Mrs. Nettlepoint and her handmaiden with the
refection prepared for her son.&nbsp; What I saw however was two
other female forms, visitors apparently just admitted, and now
ushered into the room.&nbsp; They were not announced&mdash;the
servant turned her back on them and rambled off to our
hostess.&nbsp; They advanced in a wavering tentative unintroduced
way&mdash;partly, I could see, because the place was dark and
partly because their visit was in its nature experimental, a
flight of imagination or a stretch of confidence.&nbsp; One of
the ladies was stout and the other slim, and I made sure in a
moment that one was talkative and the other reserved.&nbsp; It
was further to be discerned that one was elderly and the other
young, as well as that the fact of their unlikeness didn&rsquo;t
prevent their being mother and daughter.&nbsp; Mrs. Nettlepoint
reappeared in a very few minutes, but the interval had sufficed
to establish a communication&mdash;really copious for the
occasion&mdash;between the strangers and the unknown gentleman
whom they found in possession, hat and stick in hand.&nbsp; This
was not my doing&mdash;for what had I to go upon?&mdash;and still
less was it the doing of the younger and the more indifferent, or
less courageous, lady.&nbsp; She spoke but once&mdash;when her
companion informed me that she was going out to Europe the next
day to be married.&nbsp; Then she protested &ldquo;Oh
mother!&rdquo; in a tone that struck me in the darkness as doubly
odd, exciting my curiosity to see her face.</p>
<p>It had taken the elder woman but a moment to come to that, and
to various other things, after I had explained that I myself was
waiting for Mrs. Nettlepoint, who would doubtless soon come
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she won&rsquo;t know me&mdash;I guess she
hasn&rsquo;t ever heard much about me,&rdquo; the good lady said;
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve come from Mrs. Allen and I guess that will
make it all right.&nbsp; I presume you know Mrs.
Allen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was unacquainted with this influential personage, but I
assented vaguely to the proposition.&nbsp; Mrs. Allen&rsquo;s
emissary was good-humoured and familiar, but rather appealing
than insistent (she remarked that if her friend <i>had</i> found
time to come in the afternoon&mdash;she had so much to do, being
just up for the day, that she couldn&rsquo;t be sure&mdash;it
would be all right); and somehow even before she mentioned
Merrimac Avenue (they had come all the way from there) my
imagination had associated her with that indefinite social limbo
known to the properly-constituted Boston mind as the South
End&mdash;a nebulous region which condenses here and there into a
pretty face, in which the daughters are an
&ldquo;improvement&rdquo; on the mothers and are sometimes
acquainted with gentlemen more gloriously domiciled, gentlemen
whose wives and sisters are in turn not acquainted with them.</p>
<p>When at last Mrs. Nettlepoint came in, accompanied by candles
and by a tray laden with glasses of coloured fluid which emitted
a cool tinkling, I was in a position to officiate as master of
the ceremonies, to introduce Mrs. Mavis and Miss Grace Mavis, to
represent that Mrs. Allen had recommended them&mdash;nay, had
urged them&mdash;just to come that way, informally and without
fear; Mrs. Allen who had been prevented only by the pressure of
occupations so characteristic of her (especially when up from
Mattapoisett for a few hours&rsquo; desperate shopping) from
herself calling in the course of the day to explain who they were
and what was the favour they had to ask of her benevolent
friend.&nbsp; Good-natured women understand each other even when
so divided as to sit residentially above and below the salt, as
who should say; by which token our hostess had quickly mastered
the main facts: Mrs. Allen&rsquo;s visit that morning in Merrimac
Avenue to talk of Mrs. Amber&rsquo;s great idea, the classes at
the public schools in vacation (she was interested with an equal
charity to that of Mrs. Mavis&mdash;even in such
weather!&mdash;in those of the South End) for games and exercises
and music, to keep the poor unoccupied children out of the
streets; then the revelation that it had suddenly been settled
almost from one hour to the other that Grace should sail for
Liverpool, Mr. Porterfield at last being ready.&nbsp; He was
taking a little holiday; his mother was with him, they had come
over from Paris to see some of the celebrated old buildings in
England, and he had telegraphed to say that if Grace would start
right off they would just finish it up and be married.&nbsp; It
often happened that when things had dragged on that way for years
they were all huddled up at the end.&nbsp; Of course in such a
case she, Mrs. Mavis, had had to fly round.&nbsp; Her
daughter&rsquo;s passage was taken, but it seemed too dreadful
she should make her journey all alone, the first time she had
ever been at sea, without any companion or escort.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> couldn&rsquo;t go&mdash;Mr. Mavis was too sick: she
hadn&rsquo;t even been able to get him off to the seaside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s going in that
ship,&rdquo; Mrs. Allen had said; and she had represented that
nothing was simpler than to give her the girl in charge.&nbsp;
When Mrs. Mavis had replied that this was all very well but that
she didn&rsquo;t know the lady, Mrs. Allen had declared that that
didn&rsquo;t make a speck of difference, for Mrs. Nettlepoint was
kind enough for anything.&nbsp; It was easy enough to <i>know</i>
her, if that was all the trouble!&nbsp; All Mrs. Mavis would have
to do would be to go right up to her next morning, when she took
her daughter to the ship (she would see her there on the deck
with her party) and tell her fair and square what she
wanted.&nbsp; Mrs. Nettlepoint had daughters herself and would
easily understand.&nbsp; Very likely she&rsquo;d even look after
Grace a little on the other side, in such a queer situation,
going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to: she&rsquo;d
just help her, like a good Samaritan, to turn round before she
was married.&nbsp; Mr. Porterfield seemed to think they
wouldn&rsquo;t wait long, once she was there: they would have it
right over at the American consul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mrs. Allen had
said it would perhaps be better still to go and see Mrs.
Nettlepoint beforehand, that day, to tell her what they wanted:
then they wouldn&rsquo;t seem to spring it on her just as she was
leaving.&nbsp; She herself (Mrs. Allen) would call and say a word
for them if she could save ten minutes before catching her
train.&nbsp; If she hadn&rsquo;t come it was because she
hadn&rsquo;t saved her ten minutes but she had made them feel
that they must come all the same.&nbsp; Mrs. Mavis liked that
better, because on the ship in the morning there would be such a
confusion.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t think her daughter would be any
trouble&mdash;conscientiously she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It was just
to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a
servant-girl going to a situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, I&rsquo;m to act as a sort of bridesmaid and to
give her away,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint obligingly said.&nbsp;
Kind enough in fact for anything, she showed on this occasion
that it was easy enough to know her.&nbsp; There is notoriously
nothing less desirable than an imposed aggravation of effort at
sea, but she accepted without betrayed dismay the burden of the
young lady&rsquo;s dependence and allowed her, as Mrs. Mavis
said, to hook herself on.&nbsp; She evidently had the habit of
patience, and her reception of her visitors&rsquo; story reminded
me afresh&mdash;I was reminded of it whenever I returned to my
native land&mdash;that my dear compatriots are the people in the
world who most freely take mutual accommodation for
granted.&nbsp; They have always had to help themselves, and have
rather magnanimously failed to learn just where helping others is
distinguishable from that.&nbsp; In no country are there fewer
forms and more reciprocities.</p>
<p>It was doubtless not singular that the ladies from Merrimac
Avenue shouldn&rsquo;t feel they were importunate: what was
striking was that Mrs. Nettlepoint didn&rsquo;t appear to suspect
it.&nbsp; However, she would in any case have thought it inhuman
to show this&mdash;though I could see that under the surface she
was amused at everything the more expressive of the pilgrims from
the South End took for granted.&nbsp; I scarce know whether the
attitude of the younger visitor added or not to the merit of her
good nature.&nbsp; Mr. Porterfield&rsquo;s intended took no part
in the demonstration, scarcely spoke, sat looking at the Back Bay
and the lights on the long bridge.&nbsp; She declined the
lemonade and the other mixtures which, at Mrs.
Nettlepoint&rsquo;s request, I offered her, while her mother
partook freely of everything and I reflected&mdash;for I as
freely drained a glass or two in which the ice tinkled&mdash;that
Mr. Jasper had better hurry back if he wished to enjoy these
luxuries.</p>
<p>Was the effect of the young woman&rsquo;s reserve meanwhile
ungracious, or was it only natural that in her particular
situation she shouldn&rsquo;t have a flow of compliment at her
command?&nbsp; I noticed that Mrs. Nettlepoint looked at her
often, and certainly though she was undemonstrative Miss Mavis
was interesting.&nbsp; The candlelight enabled me to see that
though not in the very first flower of her youth she was still
fresh and handsome.&nbsp; Her eyes and hair were dark, her face
was pale, and she held up her head as if, with its thick braids
and everything else involved in it, it were an appurtenance she
wasn&rsquo;t ashamed of.&nbsp; If her mother was excellent and
common she was not common&mdash;not at least flagrantly
so&mdash;and perhaps also not excellent.&nbsp; At all events she
wouldn&rsquo;t be, in appearance at least, a dreary appendage;
which in the case of a person &ldquo;hooking on&rdquo; was always
something gained.&nbsp; Was it because something of a romantic or
pathetic interest usually attaches to a good creature who has
been the victim of a &ldquo;long engagement&rdquo; that this
young lady made an impression on me from the first&mdash;favoured
as I had been so quickly with this glimpse of her history?&nbsp;
I could charge her certainly with no positive appeal; she only
held her tongue and smiled, and her smile corrected whatever
suggestion might have forced itself upon me that the spirit
within her was dead&mdash;the spirit of that promise of which she
found herself doomed to carry out the letter.</p>
<p>What corrected it less, I must add, was an odd recollection
which gathered vividness as I listened to it&mdash;a mental
association evoked by the name of Mr. Porterfield.&nbsp; Surely I
had a personal impression, over-smeared and confused, of the
gentleman who was waiting at Liverpool, or who presently would
be, for Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;e.&nbsp; I
had met him, known him, some time, somewhere, somehow, on the
other side.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he studying something, very hard,
somewhere&mdash;probably in Paris&mdash;ten years before, and
didn&rsquo;t he make extraordinarily neat drawings, linear and
architectural?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he go to a table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te, at two francs twenty-five, in the Rue
Bonaparte, which I then frequented, and didn&rsquo;t he wear
spectacles and a Scotch plaid arranged in a manner which seemed
to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve trustworthy information that
that&rsquo;s the way they do it in the Highlands&rdquo;?&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t he exemplary to positive irritation, and very poor,
poor to positive oppression, so that I supposed he had no
overcoat and his tartan would be what he slept under at
night?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t he working very hard still, and
wouldn&rsquo;t he be, in the natural course, not yet satisfied
that he had found his feet or knew enough to launch out?&nbsp; He
would be a man of long preparations&mdash;Miss Mavis&rsquo;s
white face seemed to speak to one of that.&nbsp; It struck me
that if I had been in love with her I shouldn&rsquo;t have needed
to lay such a train for the closer approach.&nbsp; Architecture
was his line and he was a pupil of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux
Arts.&nbsp; This reminiscence grew so much more vivid with me
that at the end of ten minutes I had an odd sense of
knowing&mdash;by implication&mdash;a good deal about the young
lady.</p>
<p>Even after it was settled that Mrs. Nettlepoint would do
everything possible for her the other visitor sat sipping our
iced liquid and telling how &ldquo;low&rdquo; Mr. Mavis had
been.&nbsp; At this period the girl&rsquo;s silence struck me as
still more conscious, partly perhaps because she deprecated her
mother&rsquo;s free flow&mdash;she was enough of an
&ldquo;improvement&rdquo; to measure that&mdash;and partly
because she was too distressed by the idea of leaving her infirm,
her perhaps dying father.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t indistinguishable
that they were poor and that she would take out a very small
purse for her trousseau.&nbsp; For Mr. Porterfield to make up the
sum his own case would have had moreover greatly to change.&nbsp;
If he had enriched himself by the successful practice of his
profession I had encountered no edifice he had reared&mdash;his
reputation hadn&rsquo;t come to my ears.</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint notified her new friends that she was a very
inactive person at sea: she was prepared to suffer to the full
with Miss Mavis, but not prepared to pace the deck with her, to
struggle with her, to accompany her to meals.&nbsp; To this the
girl replied that she would trouble her little, she was sure: she
was convinced she should prove a wretched sailor and spend the
voyage on her back.&nbsp; Her mother scoffed at this picture,
prophesying perfect weather and a lovely time, and I interposed
to the effect that if I might be trusted, as a tame bachelor
fairly sea-seasoned, I should be delighted to give the new member
of our party an arm or any other countenance whenever she should
require it.&nbsp; Both the ladies thanked me for
this&mdash;taking my professions with no sort of
abatement&mdash;and the elder one declared that we were evidently
going to be such a sociable group that it was too bad to have to
stay at home.&nbsp; She asked Mrs. Nettlepoint if there were any
one else in our party, and when our hostess mentioned her
son&mdash;there was a chance of his embarking but (wasn&rsquo;t
it absurd?) he hadn&rsquo;t decided yet&mdash;she returned with
extraordinary candour: &ldquo;Oh dear, I do hope he&rsquo;ll go:
that would be so lovely for Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow the words made me think of poor Mr.
Porterfield&rsquo;s tartan, especially as Jasper Nettlepoint
strolled in again at that moment.&nbsp; His mother at once
challenged him: it was ten o&rsquo;clock; had he by chance made
up his great mind?&nbsp; Apparently he failed to hear her, being
in the first place surprised at the strange ladies and then
struck with the fact that one of them wasn&rsquo;t strange.&nbsp;
The young man, after a slight hesitation, greeted Miss Mavis with
a handshake and a &ldquo;Oh good-evening, how do you
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t utter her name&mdash;which I
could see he must have forgotten; but she immediately pronounced
his, availing herself of the American girl&rsquo;s discretion to
&ldquo;present&rdquo; him to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might have told me you knew him all this
time!&rdquo; that lady jovially cried.&nbsp; Then she had an
equal confidence for Mrs. Nettlepoint.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would have
saved me a worry&mdash;an acquaintance already begun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah my son&rsquo;s acquaintances!&rdquo; our hostess
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and my daughter&rsquo;s too!&rdquo; Mrs. Mavis
gaily echoed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Allen didn&rsquo;t tell us
<i>you</i> were going,&rdquo; she continued to the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d have been clever if she had been able
to!&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, I have my telegram,&rdquo; Jasper
remarked, looking at Grace Mavis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you very little,&rdquo; the girl said, returning
his observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve danced with you at some ball&mdash;for some
sufferers by something or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was an inundation or a big fire,&rdquo; she
a little languidly smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it was a long time
ago&mdash;and I haven&rsquo;t seen you since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in far countries&mdash;to my
loss.&nbsp; I should have said it was a big fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at the Horticultural Hall.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
remember your name,&rdquo; said Grace Mavis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very unkind of you, when I recall vividly
that you had a pink dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I remember that dress&mdash;your strawberry
tarletan: you looked lovely in it!&rdquo; Mrs. Mavis broke
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must get another just like it&mdash;on the
other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your daughter looked charming in it,&rdquo; said
Jasper Nettlepoint.&nbsp; Then he added to the girl: &ldquo;Yet
you mentioned my name to your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came back to me&mdash;seeing you here.&nbsp; I had
no idea this was your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I confess it isn&rsquo;t, much.&nbsp; Oh there
are some drinks!&rdquo;&mdash;he approached the tray and its
glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed there are and quite delicious&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
Mavis largely wiped her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have another then?&mdash;a pink one,
like your daughter&rsquo;s gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, sir.&nbsp; Oh do see them over,&rdquo;
Mrs. Mavis continued, accepting from the young man&rsquo;s hand a
third tumbler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother and that gentleman?&nbsp; Surely they can
take care of themselves,&rdquo; he freely pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then my daughter&mdash;she has a claim as an old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his mother had by this time interposed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jasper, what does your telegram say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paid her no heed: he stood there with his glass in his
hand, looking from Mrs. Mavis to Miss Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah leave her to me, madam; I&rsquo;m quite
competent,&rdquo; I said to Mrs. Mavis.</p>
<p>Then the young man gave me his attention.&nbsp; The next
minute he asked of the girl: &ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;re
going to Europe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tomorrow.&nbsp; In the same ship as your
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve come here for, to see all
about it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mavis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, take pity on me and tell me what light your
telegram throws,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, dearest, when I&rsquo;ve quenched my
thirst.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he slowly drained his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare you&rsquo;re worse than Gracie,&rdquo;
Mrs. Mavis commented.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was first one thing and
then the other&mdash;but only about up to three o&rsquo;clock
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me&mdash;won&rsquo;t you take something?&rdquo;
Jasper inquired of Gracie; who however still declined, as if to
make up for her mother&rsquo;s copious <i>consommation</i>.&nbsp;
I found myself quite aware that the two ladies would do well to
take leave, the question of Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s good will
being so satisfactorily settled and the meeting of the morrow at
the ship so near at hand and I went so far as to judge that their
protracted stay, with their hostess visibly in a fidget, gave the
last proof of their want of breeding.&nbsp; Miss Grace after all
then was not such an improvement on her mother, for she easily
might have taken the initiative of departure, in spite of Mrs.
Mavis&rsquo;s evident &ldquo;game&rdquo; of making her own
absorption of refreshment last as long as possible.&nbsp; I
watched the girl with increasing interest; I couldn&rsquo;t help
asking myself a question or two about her and even perceiving
already (in a dim and general way) that rather marked
embarrassment, or at least anxiety attended her.&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t it complicating that she should have needed, by
remaining long enough, to assuage a certain suspense, to learn
whether or no Jasper were going to sail?&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t
something particular passed between them on the occasion or at
the period to which we had caught their allusion, and
didn&rsquo;t she really not know her mother was bringing her to
<i>his</i> mother&rsquo;s, though she apparently had thought it
well not to betray knowledge?&nbsp; Such things were
symptomatic&mdash;though indeed one scarce knew of what&mdash;on
the part of a young lady betrothed to that curious cross-barred
phantom of a Mr. Porterfield.&nbsp; But I am bound to add that
she gave me no further warrant for wonder than was conveyed in
her all tacitly and covertly encouraging her mother to
linger.&nbsp; Somehow I had a sense that <i>she</i> was conscious
of the indecency of this.&nbsp; I got up myself to go, but Mrs.
Nettlepoint detained me after seeing that my movement
wouldn&rsquo;t be taken as a hint, and I felt she wished me not
to leave my fellow visitors on her hands.&nbsp; Jasper complained
of the closeness of the room, said that it was not a night to sit
in a room&mdash;one ought to be out in the air, under the
sky.&nbsp; He denounced the windows that overlooked the water for
not opening upon a balcony or a terrace, until his mother, whom
he hadn&rsquo;t yet satisfied about his telegram, reminded him
that there was a beautiful balcony in front, with room for a
dozen people.&nbsp; She assured him we would go and sit there if
it would please him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be nice and cool tomorrow, when we steam into
the great ocean,&rdquo; said Miss Mavis, expressing with more
vivacity than she had yet thrown into any of her utterances my
own thought of half an hour before.&nbsp; Mrs. Nettlepoint
replied that it would probably be freezing cold, and her son
murmured that he would go and try the drawing-room balcony and
report upon it.&nbsp; Just as he was turning away he said,
smiling, to Miss Mavis: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me and
see if it&rsquo;s pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well, we had better not stay all night!&rdquo; her
mother exclaimed, but still without moving.&nbsp; The girl moved,
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation;&mdash;she rose and accompanied
Jasper to the other room.&nbsp; I saw how her slim tallness
showed to advantage as she walked, and that she looked well as
she passed, with her head thrown back, into the darkness of the
other part of the house.&nbsp; There was something rather marked,
rather surprising&mdash;I scarcely knew why, for the act in
itself was simple enough&mdash;in her acceptance of such a plea,
and perhaps it was our sense of this that held the rest of us
somewhat stiffly silent as she remained away.&nbsp; I was waiting
for Mrs. Mavis to go, so that I myself might go; and Mrs.
Nettlepoint was waiting for her to go so that I
mightn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; This doubtless made the young lady&rsquo;s
absence appear to us longer than it really was&mdash;it was
probably very brief.&nbsp; Her mother moreover, I think, had now
a vague lapse from ease.&nbsp; Jasper Nettlepoint presently
returned to the back drawing-room to serve his companion with our
lucent syrup, and he took occasion to remark that it was lovely
on the balcony: one really got some air, the breeze being from
that quarter.&nbsp; I remembered, as he went away with his
tinkling tumbler, that from <i>my</i> hand, a few minutes before,
Miss Mavis had not been willing to accept this innocent
offering.&nbsp; A little later Mrs. Nettlepoint said:
&ldquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s so pleasant there we had better go
ourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we passed to the front and in the
other room met the two young people coming in from the
balcony.&nbsp; I was to wonder, in the light of later things,
exactly how long they had occupied together a couple of the set
of cane chairs garnishing the place in summer.&nbsp; If it had
been but five minutes that only made subsequent events more
curious.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must go, mother,&rdquo; Miss Mavis
immediately said; and a moment after, with a little renewal of
chatter as to our general meeting on the ship, the visitors had
taken leave.&nbsp; Jasper went down with them to the door and as
soon as they had got off Mrs. Nettlepoint quite richly exhaled
her impression.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah but&rsquo;ll she be a
bore&mdash;she&rsquo;ll be a bore of bores!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not through talking too much, surely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An affectation of silence is as bad.&nbsp; I hate that
particular <i>pose</i>; it&rsquo;s coming up very much now; an
imitation of the English, like everything else.&nbsp; A girl who
tries to be statuesque at sea&mdash;that will act on one&rsquo;s
nerves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what she tries to be, but she
succeeds in being very handsome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better for you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave her
to you, for I shall be shut up.&nbsp; I like her being placed
under my &lsquo;care&rsquo;!&rdquo; my friend cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be under Jasper&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah he won&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she wailed&mdash;&ldquo;I
want it too much!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t see it that way.&nbsp; I have an
idea he&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he tell me so then&mdash;when he came
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was diverted by that young woman&mdash;a beautiful
unexpected girl sitting there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diverted from his mother and her fond hope?&mdash;his
mother trembling for his decision?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;I pieced it
together&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;s an old friend, older than we
know.&nbsp; It was a meeting after a long separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, such a lot of them as he does know!&rdquo; Mrs.
Nettlepoint sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a lot of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has so many female friends&mdash;in the most varied
circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can close round her then,&rdquo; I returned;
&ldquo;for I on my side know, or used to know, her young
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her intended?&rdquo;&mdash;she had a light of relief
for this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very one she&rsquo;s going out to.&nbsp; He
can&rsquo;t, by the way,&rdquo; it occurred to me, &ldquo;be very
young now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How odd it sounds&mdash;her muddling after him!&rdquo;
said Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>I was going to reply that it wasn&rsquo;t odd if you knew Mr.
Porterfield, but I reflected that that perhaps only made it
odder.&nbsp; I told my companion briefly who he was&mdash;that I
had met him in the old Paris days, when I believed for a fleeting
hour that I could learn to paint, when I lived with the
<i>jeunesse des &eacute;coles</i>; and her comment on this was
simply: &ldquo;Well, he had better have come out for
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so.&nbsp; She looked to me as she sat there as
if, she might change her mind at the last moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About her marriage?</p>
<p>&ldquo;About sailing.&nbsp; But she won&rsquo;t change
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper came back, and his mother instantly challenged
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, <i>are</i> you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall go&rdquo;&mdash;he was finally at peace
about it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh your telegram!&rdquo;&mdash;I ventured a little to
jeer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That charming girl&rsquo;s your telegram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave me a look, but in the dusk I couldn&rsquo;t make out
very well what it conveyed.&nbsp; Then he bent over his mother,
kissing her.&nbsp; &ldquo;My news isn&rsquo;t particularly
satisfactory.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going for <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you humbug!&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; But she was of
course delighted.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">People</span> usually spend the first
hours of a voyage in squeezing themselves into their cabins,
taking their little precautions, either so excessive or so
inadequate, wondering how they can pass so many days in such a
hole and asking idiotic questions of the stewards, who appear in
comparison rare men of the world.&nbsp; My own initiations were
rapid, as became an old sailor, and so, it seemed, were Miss
Mavis&rsquo;s, for when I mounted to the deck at the end of half
an hour I found her there alone, in the stern of the ship, her
eyes on the dwindling continent.&nbsp; It dwindled very fast for
so big a place.&nbsp; I accosted her, having had no conversation
with her amid the crowd of leave-takers and the muddle of
farewells before we put off; we talked a little about the boat,
our fellow-passengers and our prospects, and then I said:
&ldquo;I think you mentioned last night a name I know&mdash;that
of Mr. Porterfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she answered very straight
while she smiled at me through her closely-drawn veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was your mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely it was my mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
continued to smile as if I ought to have known the
difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I venture to allude to him because I&rsquo;ve an idea I
used to know him,&rdquo; I went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I see.&rdquo;&nbsp; And beyond this remark she
appeared to take no interest; she left it to me to make any
connexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is if it&rsquo;s the same one.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
struck me as feeble to say nothing more; so I added &ldquo;My Mr.
Porterfield was called David.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so is ours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ours&rdquo;
affected me as clever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall see him again if he&rsquo;s to meet
you at Liverpool,&rdquo; I continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it will be bad if he doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too soon for me to have the idea that it would be bad
if he did: that only came later.&nbsp; So I remarked that, not
having seen him for so many years, it was very possible I
shouldn&rsquo;t know him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve not seen him for a considerable time,
but I expect I shall know him all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh with you it&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; I returned
with harmlessly bright significance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he
been back since those days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she sturdily professed,
&ldquo;what days you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I knew him in Paris&mdash;ages ago.&nbsp; He was a
pupil of the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts.&nbsp; He was studying
architecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s studying it still,&rdquo; said Grace
Mavis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he learned it yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he has learned.&nbsp; I shall
see.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she added for the benefit of my perhaps
undue levity: &ldquo;Architecture&rsquo;s very difficult and
he&rsquo;s tremendously thorough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I remember that.&nbsp; He was an admirable
worker.&nbsp; But he must have become quite a foreigner if
it&rsquo;s so many years since he has been at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to regard this proposition at first as complicated;
but she did what she could for me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;s not
changeable.&nbsp; If he were changeable&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, however, she paused.&nbsp; I daresay she had been going
to observe that if he were changeable he would long ago have
given her up.&nbsp; After an instant she went on: &ldquo;He
wouldn&rsquo;t have stuck so to his profession.&nbsp; You
can&rsquo;t make much by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sought to attenuate her rather odd maidenly grimness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It depends on what you call much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t make you rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh of course you&rsquo;ve got to practise it&mdash;and
to practise it long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;so Mr. Porterfield says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the way she uttered these words made me
laugh&mdash;they were so calm an implication that the gentleman
in question didn&rsquo;t live up to his principles.&nbsp; But I
checked myself, asking her if she expected to remain in Europe
long&mdash;to what one might call settle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it will be a good while if it takes me as long to
come back as it has taken me to go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think your mother said last night that it was
your first visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Mavis, in her deliberate way, met my eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t mother talk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued to look at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
think that,&rdquo; she then simply stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I to gain then by saying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh men have always something to gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me in that case feel a terrible failure!&nbsp;
I hope at any rate that it gives you pleasure,&rdquo; I went on,
&ldquo;the idea of seeing foreign lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy&mdash;I should think so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was almost genial, and it cheered me
proportionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity our ship&rsquo;s
not one of the fast ones, if you&rsquo;re impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent a little after which she brought out: &ldquo;Oh
I guess it&rsquo;ll be fast enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening I went in to see Mrs. Nettlepoint and sat on her
sea-trunk, which was pulled out from under the berth to
accommodate me.&nbsp; It was nine o&rsquo;clock but not quite
dark, as our northward course had already taken us into the
latitude of the longer days.&nbsp; She had made her nest
admirably and now rested from her labours; she lay upon her sofa
in a dressing-gown and a cap that became her.&nbsp; It was her
regular practice to spend the voyage in her cabin, which smelt
positively good&mdash;such was the refinement of her art; and she
had a secret peculiar to herself for keeping her port open
without shipping seas.&nbsp; She hated what she called the mess
of the ship and the idea, if she should go above, of meeting
stewards with plates of supererogatory food.&nbsp; She professed
to be content with her situation&mdash;we promised to lend each
other books and I assured her familiarly that I should be in and
out of her room a dozen times a day&mdash;pitying me for having
to mingle in society.&nbsp; She judged this a limited privilege,
for on the deck before we left the wharf she had taken a view of
our fellow-passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m an inveterate, almost a professional
observer,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and with that vice I&rsquo;m
as well occupied as an old woman in the sun with her
knitting.&nbsp; It makes me, in any situation, just inordinately
and submissively <i>see</i> things.&nbsp; I shall see them even
here and shall come down very often and tell you about
them.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not interested today, but you will be
tomorrow, for a ship&rsquo;s a great school of gossip.&nbsp; You
won&rsquo;t believe the number of researches and problems
you&rsquo;ll be engaged in by the middle of the
voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Never in the world!&mdash;lying here with my
nose in a book and not caring a straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll participate at second hand.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll see through my eyes, hang upon my lips, take sides,
feel passions, all sorts of sympathies and indignations.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve an idea,&rdquo; I further developed, &ldquo;that your
young lady&rsquo;s the person on board who will interest me
most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mine&rsquo; indeed!&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t been
near me since we left the dock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are&mdash;you do feel she owes you
something.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s very
curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve such cold-blooded terms!&rdquo; Mrs.
Nettlepoint wailed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Elle ne sait pas se conduire;
she ought to have come to ask about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, since you&rsquo;re under her care,&rdquo; I
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for her not knowing how to
behave&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s exactly what we shall
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, but not I!&nbsp; I wash my hands of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;don&rsquo;t say
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint looked at me a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do
you speak so solemnly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In return I considered her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
before we land.&nbsp; And have you seen much of your
son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he has come in several times.&nbsp; He seems
very much pleased.&nbsp; He has got a cabin to
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great luck,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ve an idea he&rsquo;s always in luck.&nbsp; I was sure I
should have to offer him the second berth in my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed that, because you
don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; she took upon herself to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What put that into your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in my head&mdash;it&rsquo;s in my heart,
my <i>c&oelig;ur de m&egrave;re</i>.&nbsp; We guess those
things.&nbsp; You think he&rsquo;s selfish.&nbsp; I could see it
last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lady,&rdquo; I contrived promptly enough to reply,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no general ideas about him at all.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s just one of the phenomena I am going to observe.&nbsp;
He seems to me a very fine young man.&nbsp; However,&rdquo; I
added, &ldquo;since you&rsquo;ve mentioned last night I&rsquo;ll
admit that I thought he rather tantalised you.&nbsp; He played
with your suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he came at the last just to please me,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>I was silent a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you sure it was for
your sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, perhaps it was for yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bore up, however, against this thrust, characteristic of
perfidious woman when you presume to side with her against a fond
tormentor.&nbsp; &ldquo;When he went out on the balcony with that
girl,&rdquo; I found assurance to suggest, &ldquo;perhaps she
asked him to come for <i>hers</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she did.&nbsp; But why should he do everything
she asks him&mdash;such as she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet, but perhaps I shall know
later.&nbsp; Not that he&rsquo;ll tell me&mdash;for he&rsquo;ll
never tell me anything: he&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; I consistently
opined, &ldquo;one of those who tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t ask him, what you say is a great
wrong to her,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But you say that to
protect Jasper&mdash;not to protect her,&rdquo; I smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> cold-blooded&mdash;it&rsquo;s
uncanny!&rdquo; my friend exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah this is nothing yet!&nbsp; Wait a
while&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; At sea in general I&rsquo;m
awful&mdash;I exceed the limits.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;ve outraged her
in thought I&rsquo;ll jump overboard.&nbsp; There are ways of
asking&mdash;a man doesn&rsquo;t need to tell a woman
that&mdash;without the crude words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you imagine between
them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nothing,&rdquo; I allowed, &ldquo;but what was
visible on the surface.&nbsp; It transpired, as the newspapers
say, that they were old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He met her at some promiscuous party&mdash;I asked him
about it afterwards.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not a
person&rdquo;&mdash;my hostess was confident&mdash;&ldquo;whom he
could ever think of seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t observe&mdash;you know&mdash;you
imagine,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint continued to argue.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you reconcile her laying a trap for Jasper with her
going out to Liverpool on an errand of love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh I wasn&rsquo;t to be caught that way!&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t for an instant suppose she laid a trap; I believe she
acted on the impulse of the moment.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s going out
to Liverpool on an errand of marriage; that&rsquo;s not
necessarily the same thing as an errand of love, especially for
one who happens to have had a personal impression of the
gentleman she&rsquo;s engaged to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are certain decencies which in such a
situation the most abandoned of her sex would still
observe.&nbsp; You apparently judge her capable&mdash;on no
evidence&mdash;of violating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you don&rsquo;t understand the shades of
things,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Decencies and violations,
dear lady&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need for such heavy
artillery!&nbsp; I can perfectly imagine that without the least
immodesty she should have said to Jasper on the balcony, in fact
if not in words: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in dreadful spirits, but if you
come I shall feel better, and that will be pleasant for you
too.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why is she in dreadful spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I replied, laughing.</p>
<p>My poor friend wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What then is she
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s walking with your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint for a moment said nothing; then she treated
me to another inconsequence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah she&rsquo;s
horrid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s charming!&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean she&rsquo;s &lsquo;curious&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for me it&rsquo;s the same thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This led my friend of course to declare once more that I was
cold-blooded.&nbsp; On the afternoon of the morrow we had another
talk, and she told me that in the morning Miss Mavis had paid her
a long visit.&nbsp; She knew nothing, poor creature, about
anything, but her intentions were good and she was evidently in
her own eyes conscientious and decorous.&nbsp; And Mrs.
Nettlepoint concluded these remarks with the sigh
&ldquo;Unfortunate person!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think she&rsquo;s a good deal to be pitied
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, her story sounds dreary&mdash;she told me a good
deal of it.&nbsp; She fell to talking little by little and went
from one thing to another.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s in that situation
when a girl <i>must</i> open herself&mdash;to some
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t she got Jasper?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a woman.&nbsp; You strike me as jealous
of him,&rdquo; my companion added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay <i>he</i> thinks so&mdash;or will before the
end.&nbsp; Ah no&mdash;ah no!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I asked Mrs.
Nettlepoint if our young lady struck her as, very grossly, a
flirt.&nbsp; She gave me no answer, but went on to remark that
she found it odd and interesting to see the way a girl like Grace
Mavis resembled the girls of the kind she herself knew better,
the girls of &ldquo;society,&rdquo; at the same time that she
differed from them; and the way the differences and resemblances
were so mixed up that on certain questions you couldn&rsquo;t
tell where you&rsquo;d find her.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think
she&rsquo;d feel as you did because you had found her feeling so,
and then suddenly, in regard to some other matter&mdash;which was
yet quite the same&mdash;she&rsquo;d be utterly wanting.&nbsp;
Mrs. Nettlepoint proceeded to observe&mdash;to such idle
speculations does the vacancy of sea-hours give
encouragement&mdash;that she wondered whether it were better to
be an ordinary girl very well brought up or an extraordinary girl
not brought up at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I go in for the extraordinary girl under all
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that if you&rsquo;re <i>very</i> well
brought up you&rsquo;re not, you can&rsquo;t be, ordinary,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Nettlepoint, smelling her strong salts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lady, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Miss Mavis is fifty miles out&mdash;is that what
you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;ve seen her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I think your contention would be that among
such people the mother doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely, and that&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you mean.&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t it rather
hard?&nbsp; If your mother doesn&rsquo;t know anything it&rsquo;s
better you should be independent of her, and yet if you are that
constitutes a bad note.&rdquo;&nbsp; I added that Mrs. Mavis had
appeared to count sufficiently two nights before.&nbsp; She had
said and done everything she wanted, while the girl sat silent
and respectful.&nbsp; Grace&rsquo;s attitude, so far as her
parent was concerned, had been eminently decent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but she &lsquo;squirmed&rsquo; for her,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah if you know it I may confess she has told me as
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Told <i>you</i>?&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s one of the things they do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was only a word.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you let me
know whether you do think her a flirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try her yourself&mdash;that&rsquo;s better than asking
another woman; especially as you pretend to study
folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh your judgement wouldn&rsquo;t probably at all
determine mine.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as bearing on <i>you</i> I ask
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, however, demanded explanation, so that I
was duly frank; confessing myself curious as to how far maternal
immorality would go.</p>
<p>It made her at first but repeat my words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maternal immorality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You desire your son to have every possible distraction
on his voyage, and if you can make up your mind in the sense I
refer to that will make it all right.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll have no
responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, how you analyse!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t in the least your passion for making up my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you chance it,&rdquo; I returned,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be more immoral still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your reasoning&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Nettlepoint; &ldquo;when it was you who tried to put into my head
yesterday that she had asked him to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but in good faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, in such a case, by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as girls of that sort do.&nbsp; Their allowance
and measure in such matters,&rdquo; I expounded, &ldquo;is much
larger than that of young persons who have been, as you say,
<i>very</i> well brought up; and yet I&rsquo;m not sure that on
the whole I don&rsquo;t think them thereby the more
innocent.&nbsp; Miss Mavis is engaged, and she&rsquo;s to be
married next week, but it&rsquo;s an old old story, and
there&rsquo;s no more romance in it than if she were going to be
photographed.&nbsp; So her usual life proceeds, and her usual
life consists&mdash;and that of <i>ces demoiselles</i> in
general&mdash;in having plenty of gentlemen&rsquo;s
society.&nbsp; Having it I mean without having any harm from
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint had given me due attention.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, if there&rsquo;s no harm from it what are you
talking about and why am I immoral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
retract&mdash;you&rsquo;re sane and clear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
she thinks there won&rsquo;t be any harm,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the great point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be settled, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy, we&rsquo;re not trying them!&rdquo; cried my
friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can <i>we</i> settle it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean of course in our minds.&nbsp; There will be
nothing more interesting these next ten days for our minds to
exercise themselves upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;ll get terribly tired of it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;because the interest will increase and the
plot will thicken.&nbsp; It simply can&rsquo;t <i>not</i>,&rdquo;
I insisted.&nbsp; She looked at me as if she thought me more than
Mephistophelean, and I went back to something she had lately
mentioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;So she told you everything in her life
was dreary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not everything, but most things.&nbsp; And she
didn&rsquo;t tell me so much as I guessed it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
tell me more the next time.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll behave properly
now about coming in to see me; I told her she ought
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keep her with you as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t follow you closely,&rdquo; Mrs.
Nettlepoint replied, &ldquo;but so far as I do I don&rsquo;t
think your remarks in the best taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m too excited, I lose my head in these
sports,&rdquo; I had to recognise&mdash;&ldquo;cold-blooded as
you think me.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t she like Mr.
Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I kept making her stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;The worst of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so good&mdash;there&rsquo;s no fault to be
found with him.&nbsp; Otherwise she&rsquo;d have thrown it all
up.&nbsp; It has dragged on since she was eighteen: she became
engaged to him before he went abroad to study.&nbsp; It was one
of those very young and perfectly needless blunders that parents
in America might make so much less possible than they do.&nbsp;
The thing is to insist on one&rsquo;s daughter waiting, on the
engagement&rsquo;s being long; and then, after you&rsquo;ve got
that started, to take it on every occasion as little seriously as
possible&mdash;to make it die out.&nbsp; You can easily tire it
to death,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint competently stated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;Mr. Porterfield has
taken this one seriously for some years.&nbsp; He has done his
part to keep it alive.&nbsp; She says he adores her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His part?&nbsp; Surely his part would have been to
marry her by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has really no money.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend was even
more confidently able to report it than I had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have got some, in seven years,&rdquo; I
audibly reflected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I think she thinks.&nbsp; There are some sorts of
helplessness that are contemptible.&nbsp; However, a small
difference has taken place.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why he won&rsquo;t
wait any longer.&nbsp; His mother has come out, she has
something&mdash;a little&mdash;and she&rsquo;s able to assist
him.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll live with them and bear some of the
expenses, and after her death the son will have what there
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is she?&rdquo; I cynically asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; But it
doesn&rsquo;t, on his part, sound very heroic&mdash;or very
inspiring for our friend here.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t been to
America since he first went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an odd way of adoring her,&rdquo; I
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made that objection mentally, but I didn&rsquo;t
express it to her.&nbsp; She met it indeed a little by telling me
that he had had other chances to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surprises me,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
did she say,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;that <i>she</i> had
had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and that&rsquo;s one of the things I thought nice
in her; for she must have had.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t try to make
out that he had spoiled her life.&nbsp; She has three other
sisters and there&rsquo;s very little money at home.&nbsp; She
has tried to make money; she has written little things and
painted little things&mdash;and dreadful little things they must
have been; too bad to think of.&nbsp; Her father has had a long
illness and has lost his place&mdash;he was in receipt of a
salary in connexion with some waterworks&mdash;and one of her
sisters has lately become a widow, with children and without
means.&nbsp; And so as in fact she never has married any one
else, whatever opportunities she may have encountered, she
appears to have just made up her mind to go out to Mr.
Porterfield as the least of her evils.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t
very amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I judged after all, &ldquo;that only makes
her doing it the more honourable.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll go through
with it, whatever it costs, rather than disappoint him after he
has waited so long.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; I continued,
&ldquo;that when a woman acts from a sense of
honour&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when she does?&rdquo; said Mrs. Nettlepoint, for
I hung back perceptibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s often so extravagant and unnatural a
proceeding as to entail heavy costs on some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very impertinent.&nbsp; We all have to pay
for each other all the while and for each other&rsquo;s virtues
as well as vices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s precisely why I shall be sorry for Mr.
Porterfield when she steps off the ship with her little
bill.&nbsp; I mean with her teeth clenched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her teeth are not in the least clenched.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s quite at her ease now&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Nettlepoint
could answer for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must try and keep her so,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must take care that Jasper neglects
nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I scarce know what reflexions this innocent
pleasantry of mine provoked on the good lady&rsquo;s part; the
upshot of them at all events was to make her say: &ldquo;Well, I
never asked her to come; I&rsquo;m very glad of that.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s all their own doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Their&rsquo; own&mdash;you mean Jasper&rsquo;s
and hers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed.&nbsp; I mean her mother&rsquo;s and Mrs.
Allen&rsquo;s; the girl&rsquo;s too of course.&nbsp; They put
themselves on us by main force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I can testify to that.&nbsp; Therefore
I&rsquo;m glad too.&nbsp; We should have missed it, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How seriously you take it!&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint
amusedly cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah wait a few days!&rdquo;&mdash;and I got up to leave
her.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Patagonia</i> was slow, but
spacious and comfortable, and there was a motherly decency in her
long nursing rock and her rustling old-fashioned gait, the
multitudinous swish, in her wake, as of a thousand proper
petticoats.&nbsp; It was as if she wished not to present herself
in port with the splashed eagerness of a young creature.&nbsp; We
weren&rsquo;t numerous enough quite to elbow each other and yet
weren&rsquo;t too few to support&mdash;with that familiarity and
relief which figures and objects acquire on the great bare field
of the ocean and under the great bright glass of the sky.&nbsp; I
had never liked the sea so much before, indeed I had never liked
it at all; but now I had a revelation of how in a midsummer mood
it could please.&nbsp; It was darkly and magnificently blue and
imperturbably quiet&mdash;save for the great regular swell of its
heartbeats, the pulse of its life; and there grew to be something
so agreeable in the sense of floating there in infinite isolation
and leisure that it was a positive godsend the <i>Patagonia</i>
was no racer.&nbsp; One had never thought of the sea as the great
place of safety, but now it came over one that there&rsquo;s no
place so safe from the land.&nbsp; When it doesn&rsquo;t confer
trouble it takes trouble away&mdash;takes away letters and
telegrams and newspapers and visits and duties and efforts, all
the complications, all the superfluities and superstitions that
we have stuffed into our terrene life.&nbsp; The simple absence
of the post, when the particular conditions enable you to enjoy
the great fact by which it&rsquo;s produced, becomes in itself a
positive bliss, and the clean boards of the deck turn to the
stage of a play that amuses, the personal drama of the voyage,
the movement and interaction, in the strong sea-light, of figures
that end by representing something&mdash;something moreover of
which the interest is never, even in its keenness, too great to
suffer you to slumber.&nbsp; I at any rate dozed to excess,
stretched on my rug with a French novel, and when I opened my
eyes I generally saw Jasper Nettlepoint pass with the young woman
confided to his mother&rsquo;s care on his arm.&nbsp; Somehow at
these moments, between sleeping and waking, I inconsequently felt
that my French novel had set them in motion.&nbsp; Perhaps this
was because I had fallen into the trick, at the start, of
regarding Grace Mavis almost as a married woman, which, as every
one knows, is the necessary status of the heroine of such a
work.&nbsp; Every revolution of our engine at any rate would
contribute to the effect of making her one.</p>
<p>In the saloon, at meals, my neighbour on the right was a
certain little Mrs. Peck, a very short and very round person
whose head was enveloped in a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; (a cloud of
dirty white wool) and who promptly let me know that she was going
to Europe for the education of her children.&nbsp; I had already
perceived&mdash;an hour after we left the dock&mdash;that some
energetic measure was required in their interest, but as we were
not in Europe yet the redemption of the four little Pecks was
stayed.&nbsp; Enjoying untrammelled leisure they swarmed about
the ship as if they had been pirates boarding her, and their
mother was as powerless to check their licence as if she had been
gagged and stowed away in the hold.&nbsp; They were especially to
be trusted to dive between the legs of the stewards when these
attendants arrived with bowls of soup for the languid
ladies.&nbsp; Their mother was too busy counting over to her
fellow-passengers all the years Miss Mavis had been
engaged.&nbsp; In the blank of our common detachment things that
were nobody&rsquo;s business very soon became everybody&rsquo;s,
and this was just one of those facts that are propagated with
mysterious and ridiculous speed.&nbsp; The whisper that carries
them is very small, in the great scale of things, of air and
space and progress, but it&rsquo;s also very safe, for
there&rsquo;s no compression, no sounding-board, to make speakers
responsible.&nbsp; And then repetition at sea is somehow not
repetition; monotony is in the air, the mind is flat and
everything recurs&mdash;the bells, the meals, the stewards&rsquo;
faces, the romp of children, the walk, the clothes, the very
shoes and buttons of passengers taking their exercise.&nbsp;
These things finally grow at once so circumstantial and so arid
that, in comparison, lights on the personal history of
one&rsquo;s companions become a substitute for the friendly
flicker of the lost fireside.</p>
<p>Jasper Nettlepoint sat on my left hand when he was not
upstairs seeing that Miss Mavis had her repast comfortably on
deck.&nbsp; His mother&rsquo;s place would have been next mine
had she shown herself, and then that of the young lady under her
care.&nbsp; These companions, in other words, would have been
between us, Jasper marking the limit of the party in that
quarter.&nbsp; Miss Mavis was present at luncheon the first day,
but dinner passed without her coming in, and when it was half
over Jasper remarked that he would go up and look after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that young lady coming&mdash;the one who
was here to lunch?&rdquo; Mrs. Peck asked of me as he left the
saloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently not.&nbsp; My friend tells me she
doesn&rsquo;t like the saloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say she&rsquo;s sick, do
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not in this weather.&nbsp; But she likes to be
above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that gentleman gone up to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s under his mother&rsquo;s
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is his mother up there, too?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Peck, whose processes were homely and direct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she remains in her cabin.&nbsp; People have
different tastes.&nbsp; Perhaps that&rsquo;s one reason why Miss
Mavis doesn&rsquo;t come to table,&rdquo; I
added&mdash;&ldquo;her chaperon not being able to accompany
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her chaperon?&rdquo; my fellow passenger echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Nettlepoint&mdash;the lady under whose protection
she happens to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Protection?&rdquo; Mrs. Peck stared at me a moment,
moving some valued morsel in her mouth; then she exclaimed
familiarly &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;&nbsp; I was struck with this and
was on the point of asking her what she meant by it when she
continued: &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we going to see Mrs.
Nettlepoint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&nbsp; She vows she won&rsquo;t
stir from her sofa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know her then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I know all about her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then my
companion added: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say she&rsquo;s
any real relation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to Grace Mavis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very new friends, as I
happen to know.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;re acquainted with our young
lady?&rdquo;&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t noticed the passage of any
recognition between them at luncheon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she your young lady too?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Peck with
high significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah when people are in the same
boat&mdash;literally&mdash;they belong a little to each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know Miss Mavis, but I know all about her&mdash;I
live opposite to her on Merrimac Avenue.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
whether you know that part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consequence of this remark was another
&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mrs. Peck went on: &ldquo;When
you&rsquo;ve lived opposite to people like that for a long time
you feel as if you had some rights in them&mdash;tit for
tat!&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t take it up today; she
didn&rsquo;t speak to me.&nbsp; She knows who I am as well as she
knows her own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better speak to her first&mdash;she&rsquo;s
constitutionally shy,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shy?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s constitutionally tough!&nbsp;
Why she&rsquo;s thirty years old,&rdquo; cried my
neighbour.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose you know where she&rsquo;s
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;we all take an interest in
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young man, I suppose, particularly.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then as I feigned a vagueness: &ldquo;The handsome one who
sits <i>there</i>.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you tell me he&rsquo;s Mrs.
Nettlepoint&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;he acts as her deputy.&nbsp; No doubt he
does all he can to carry out her function.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peck briefly brooded.&nbsp; I had spoken jocosely, but
she took it with a serious face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, she might let
him eat his dinner in peace!&rdquo; she presently put forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;ll come back!&rdquo; I said, glancing at
his place.&nbsp; The repast continued and when it was finished I
screwed my chair round to leave the table.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck
performed the same movement and we quitted the saloon
together.&nbsp; Outside of it was the usual vestibule, with
several seats, from which you could descend to the lower cabins
or mount to the promenade-deck.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck appeared to
hesitate as to her course and then solved the problem by going
neither way.&nbsp; She dropped on one of the benches and looked
up at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you said he&rsquo;d come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Nettlepoint?&nbsp; Yes, I see he
didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Miss Mavis then has given him half her
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of her!&nbsp; She has been engaged
half her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that will soon be over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I suppose&mdash;as quick as ever we land.&nbsp;
Every one knows it on Merrimac Avenue,&rdquo; Mrs. Peck
pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every one there takes a great interest in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah of course&mdash;a girl like that has many
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my informant discriminated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean even
people who don&rsquo;t know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; I went on: &ldquo;she&rsquo;s so handsome
that she attracts attention&mdash;people enter into her
affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peck spoke as from the commanding centre of these.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She <i>used</i> to be pretty, but I can&rsquo;t say I
think she&rsquo;s anything remarkable today.&nbsp; Anyhow, if she
attracts attention she ought to be all the more careful what she
does.&nbsp; You had better tell her that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s none of my business!&rdquo; I easily made
out, leaving the terrible little woman and going above.&nbsp;
This profession, I grant, was not perfectly attuned to my real
idea, or rather my real idea was not quite in harmony with my
profession.&nbsp; The very first thing I did on reaching the deck
was to notice that Miss Mavis was pacing it on Jasper
Nettlepoint&rsquo;s arm and that whatever beauty she might have
lost, according to Mrs. Peck&rsquo;s insinuation, she still kept
enough to make one&rsquo;s eyes follow her.&nbsp; She had put on
a crimson hood, which was very becoming to her and which she wore
for the rest of the voyage.&nbsp; She walked very well, with long
steps, and I remember that at this moment the sea had a gentle
evening swell which made the great ship dip slowly, rhythmically,
giving a movement that was graceful to graceful pedestrians and a
more awkward one to the awkward.&nbsp; It was the loveliest hour
of a fine day, the clear early evening, with the glow of the
sunset in the air and a purple colour on the deep.&nbsp; It was
always present to me that so the waters ploughed by the Homeric
heroes must have looked.&nbsp; I became conscious on this
particular occasion moreover that Grace Mavis would for the rest
of the voyage be the most visible thing in one&rsquo;s range, the
figure that would count most in the composition of groups.&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t help it, poor girl; nature had made her
conspicuous&mdash;important, as the painters say.&nbsp; She paid
for it by the corresponding exposure, the danger that people
would, as I had said to Mrs. Peck, enter into her affairs.</p>
<p>Jasper Nettlepoint went down at certain times to see his
mother, and I watched for one of these occasions&mdash;on the
third day out&mdash;and took advantage of it to go and sit by
Miss Mavis.&nbsp; She wore a light blue veil drawn tightly over
her face, so that if the smile with which she greeted me rather
lacked intensity I could account for it partly by that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re getting on&mdash;we&rsquo;re getting
on,&rdquo; I said cheerfully, looking at the friendly twinkling
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going very fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fast, but steadily.&nbsp; <i>Ohne Hast</i>, <i>ohne
Rast</i>&mdash;do you know German?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve studied it&mdash;some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be useful to you over there when you
travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well yes, if we do.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t suppose we
shall much.&nbsp; Mr. Nettlepoint says we ought,&rdquo; my young
woman added in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah of course <i>he</i> thinks so.&nbsp; He has been all
over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has described some of the places.&nbsp; They
must be wonderful.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know I should like it so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Europe&rsquo; yet!&rdquo; I
laughed.</p>
<p>Well, she didn&rsquo;t care if it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
mean going on this way.&nbsp; I could go on for ever&mdash;for
ever and ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you know it&rsquo;s not always like this,&rdquo; I
hastened to mention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better than Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so good as Paris,&rdquo; I still more
portentously noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I know all about Paris.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
freshness in that.&nbsp; I feel as if I had been there all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ve heard so much of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, nothing else for ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had come to talk with Miss Mavis because she was attractive,
but I had been rather conscious of the absence of a good topic,
not feeling at liberty to revert to Mr. Porterfield.&nbsp; She
hadn&rsquo;t encouraged me, when I spoke to her as we were
leaving Boston, to go on with the history of my acquaintance with
this gentleman; and yet now, unexpectedly, she appeared to
imply&mdash;it was doubtless one of the disparities mentioned by
Mrs. Nettlepoint&mdash;that he might be glanced at without
indelicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;you mean by letters,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t live in a good part.&nbsp; I know enough
to know that,&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t as if there were any very bad
ones,&rdquo; I answered reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Mr. Nettlepoint says it&rsquo;s regular
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to what does he apply that expression?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She eyed me a moment as if I were elegant at her expense, but
she answered my question.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up there in the
Batignolles.&nbsp; I seem to make out it&rsquo;s worse than
Merrimac Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse&mdash;in what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, even less where the nice people live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to say that,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp;
And I ventured to back it up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you call
Mr. Porterfield a nice person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it doesn&rsquo;t make any difference.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She watched me again a moment through her veil, the texture of
which gave her look a suffused prettiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
know him very little?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Nettlepoint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah very little.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very considerably my
junior, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had a fresh pause, as if almost again for my elegance; but
she went on: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s younger than me too.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t know what effect of the comic there could have been
in it, but the turn was unexpected and it made me laugh.&nbsp;
Neither do I know whether Miss Mavis took offence at my
sensibility on this head, though I remember thinking at the
moment with compunction that it had brought a flush to her
cheek.&nbsp; At all events she got up, gathering her shawl and
her books into her arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
down&mdash;I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired of me, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like you,&rdquo; I confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should like it to go on and on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had begun to walk along the deck to the companionway and I
went with her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I guess <i>I</i>
wouldn&rsquo;t, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had taken her shawl from her to carry it, but at the top of
the steps that led down to the cabins I had to give it
back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mother would be glad if she could
know,&rdquo; I observed as we parted.</p>
<p>But she was proof against my graces.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she could
know what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well you&rsquo;re getting on.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
refused to be discouraged.&nbsp; &ldquo;And that good Mrs.
Allen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother, mother!&nbsp; She made me come, she pushed
me off.&rdquo;&nbsp; And almost as if not to say more she went
quickly below.</p>
<p>I paid Mrs. Nettlepoint a morning visit after luncheon and
another in the evening, before she &ldquo;turned in.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That same day, in the evening, she said to me suddenly: &ldquo;Do
you know what I&rsquo;ve done?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve asked
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asked him what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, if <i>she</i> asked him, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Do</i> I understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s because you
&lsquo;regular&rsquo; won&rsquo;t, as she says.&nbsp; If that
girl really asked him&mdash;on the balcony&mdash;to sail with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady, do you suppose that if she did he&rsquo;d
tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had to recognise my acuteness.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
just what he says.&nbsp; But he says she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you consider the statement valuable?&rdquo; I
asked, laughing out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better ask your young
friend herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On which I was the more amused that I had to explain I was
only amused.&nbsp; &ldquo;What does it signify now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you thought everything signified.&nbsp; You
were so full,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;of
signification!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we&rsquo;re further out now, and somehow in
mid-ocean everything becomes absolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else <i>can</i> he do with decency?&rdquo; Mrs.
Nettlepoint went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;If, as my son, he were never to
speak to her it would be very rude and you&rsquo;d think that
stranger still.&nbsp; Then <i>you</i> would do what he does, and
where would be the difference?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what he does?&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t
mentioned him for twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she told me herself.&nbsp; She came in this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an odd thing to tell you!&rdquo; I commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as she says it.&nbsp; She says he&rsquo;s full of
attention, perfectly devoted&mdash;looks after her all the
time.&nbsp; She seems to want me to know it, so that I may
approve him for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s charming; it shows her good
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or her great cleverness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the tone in which Mrs. Nettlepoint said this
caused me to return in real surprise: &ldquo;Why what do you
suppose she has in her mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get hold of him, to make him go so far he
can&rsquo;t retreat.&nbsp; To marry him perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To marry him?&nbsp; And what will she do with Mr.
Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll ask me just to make it all right to
him&mdash;or perhaps you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as an old friend&rdquo;&mdash;and for a moment I
felt it awkwardly possible.&nbsp; But I put to her seriously:
&ldquo;<i>Do</i> you see Jasper caught like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s only a boy&mdash;he&rsquo;s younger at
least than she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; she regards him as a child.&nbsp; She
remarked to me herself today, that is, that he&rsquo;s so much
younger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint took this in. &ldquo;Does she talk of it with
you?&nbsp; That shows she has a plan, that she has thought it
over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sufficiently expressed&mdash;for the interest of my
anecdote&mdash;that I found an oddity in one of our young
companions, but I was far from judging her capable of laying a
trap for the other.&nbsp; Moreover my reading of Jasper
wasn&rsquo;t in the least that he was catchable&mdash;could be
made to do a thing if he didn&rsquo;t want to do it.&nbsp; Of
course it wasn&rsquo;t impossible that he might be inclined, that
he might take it&mdash;or already have taken it&mdash;into his
head to go further with his mother&rsquo;s charge; but to believe
this I should require still more proof than his always being with
her.&nbsp; He wanted at most to &ldquo;take up with her&rdquo;
for the voyage. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve questioned him perhaps
you&rsquo;ve tried to make him feel responsible,&rdquo; I said to
my fellow critic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little, but it&rsquo;s very difficult.&nbsp;
Interference makes him perverse.&nbsp; One has to go
gently.&nbsp; Besides, it&rsquo;s too absurd&mdash;think of her
age.&nbsp; If she can&rsquo;t take care of herself!&rdquo; cried
Mrs. Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us keep thinking of her age, though it&rsquo;s
not so prodigious.&nbsp; And if things get very bad you&rsquo;ve
one resource left,&rdquo; I added.</p>
<p>She wondered.&nbsp; &ldquo;To lock her up in her
cabin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;to come out of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah never, never!&nbsp; If it takes that to save her she
must be lost.&nbsp; Besides, what good would it do?&nbsp; If I
were to go above she could come below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you could keep Jasper with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Could</i> I?&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint demanded in the
manner of a woman who knew her son.</p>
<p>In the saloon the next day, after dinner, over the red cloth
of the tables, beneath the swinging lamps and the racks of
tumblers, decanters and wine-glasses, we sat down to whist, Mrs.
Peck, to oblige, taking a hand in the game.&nbsp; She played very
badly and talked too much, and when the rubber was over assuaged
her discomfiture (though not mine&mdash;we had been partners)
with a Welsh rabbit and a tumbler of something hot.&nbsp; We had
done with the cards, but while she waited for this refreshment
she sat with her elbows on the table shuffling a pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t spoken to me yet&mdash;she won&rsquo;t
do it,&rdquo; she remarked in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible there&rsquo;s any one on the ship who
hasn&rsquo;t spoken to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that girl&mdash;she knows too well!&rdquo; Mrs.
Peck looked round our little circle with a smile of
intelligence&mdash;she had familiar communicative eyes.&nbsp;
Several of our company had assembled, according to the wont, the
last thing in the evening, of those who are cheerful at sea, for
the consumption of grilled sardines and devilled bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then does she know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh she knows <i>I</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know what Mrs. Peck knows,&rdquo; one of the
ladies of the group observed to me with an air of privilege.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t know if I hadn&rsquo;t told
you&mdash;from the way she acts,&rdquo; said our friend with a
laugh of small charm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going out to a gentleman who lives over
there&mdash;he&rsquo;s waiting there to marry her,&rdquo; the
other lady went on, in the tone of authentic information.&nbsp; I
remember that her name was Mrs. Gotch and that her mouth looked
always as if she were whistling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh he knows&mdash;I&rsquo;ve told him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Peck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I presume every one knows,&rdquo; Mrs. Gotch
contributed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, is it every one&rsquo;s business?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a peculiar way to
act?&rdquo;&mdash;and Mrs. Gotch was evidently surprised at my
little protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s right there&mdash;straight in front of
you, like a play at the theatre&mdash;as if you had paid to see
it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t call
it public!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you mixing things up?&nbsp; What do you
call public?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the way they go on.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re up there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cuddle up there half the night,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gotch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when they come down.&nbsp;
Any hour they like.&nbsp; When all the lights are out
they&rsquo;re up there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you can&rsquo;t tire them out.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t want relief&mdash;like the ship&rsquo;s watch!&rdquo;
laughed one of the gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if they enjoy each other&rsquo;s society
what&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo; another asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d do just the same on land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t do it on the public streets, I
presume,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they
wouldn&rsquo;t do it if Mr. Porterfield was round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just where your confusion comes
in?&rdquo; I made answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s public enough
that Miss Mavis and Mr. Nettlepoint are always together, but it
isn&rsquo;t in the least public that she&rsquo;s going to be
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why how can you say&mdash;when the very sailors know
it!&nbsp; The Captain knows it and all the officers know
it.&nbsp; They see them there, especially at night, when
they&rsquo;re sailing the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there was some rule&mdash;!&rdquo; submitted
Mrs. Gotch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is&mdash;that you&rsquo;ve got to behave
yourself,&rdquo; Mrs. Peck explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;So the Captain
told me&mdash;he said they have some rule.&nbsp; He said they
have to have, when people are too undignified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the term he used?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he may have said when they attract too much
attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ventured to discriminate.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s we who
attract the attention&mdash;by talking about what doesn&rsquo;t
concern us and about what we really don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said the Captain said he&rsquo;d tell on her as
soon as ever we arrive,&rdquo; Mrs. Gotch none the less serenely
pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> said&mdash;?&rdquo; I repeated,
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did say so, that he&rsquo;d think it his duty
to inform Mr. Porterfield when he comes on to meet her&mdash;if
they keep it up in the same way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh they&rsquo;ll keep it up, don&rsquo;t you
fear!&rdquo; one of the gentlemen exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, the Captain&rsquo;s having his joke on
you,&rdquo; was, however, my own congruous reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t&mdash;he&rsquo;s right down
scandalised.&nbsp; He says he regards us all as a real family and
wants the family not to be downright coarse.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt
Mrs. Peck irritated by my controversial tone: she challenged me
with considerable spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can you say I
don&rsquo;t know it when all the street knows it and has known it
for years&mdash;for years and years?&rdquo;&nbsp; She spoke as if
the girl had been engaged at least for twenty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s she going out for if not to marry
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s going to see how he looks,&rdquo;
suggested one of the gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d look queer&mdash;if he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess he&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Gotch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d tell him herself&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t
be afraid,&rdquo; the gentleman went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well she might as well kill him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll jump
overboard,&rdquo; Mrs. Peck could foretell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump overboard?&rdquo; cried Mrs. Gotch as if she hoped
then that Mr. Porterfield would be told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has just been waiting for this&mdash;for long, long
years,&rdquo; said Mrs. Peck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to know him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She replied at her convenience.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, but I know a
lady who does.&nbsp; Are you going up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had risen from my place&mdash;I had not ordered
supper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a turn before going
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the saloon I hesitated, for Mrs. Peck&rsquo;s
admonition made me feel for a moment that if I went up I should
have entered in a manner into her little conspiracy.&nbsp; But
the night was so warm and splendid that I had been intending to
smoke a cigar in the air before going below, and I didn&rsquo;t
see why I should deprive myself of this pleasure in order to seem
not to mind Mrs. Peck.&nbsp; I mounted accordingly and saw a few
figures sitting or moving about in the darkness.&nbsp; The ocean
looked black and small, as it is apt to do at night, and the long
mass of the ship, with its vague dim wings, seemed to take up a
great part of it.&nbsp; There were more stars than one saw on
land and the heavens struck one more than ever as larger than the
earth.&nbsp; Grace Mavis and her companion were not, so far as I
perceived at first, among the few passengers who lingered late,
and I was glad, because I hated to hear her talked about in the
manner of the gossips I had left at supper.&nbsp; I wished there
had been some way to prevent it, but I could think of none but to
recommend her privately to reconsider her rule of
discretion.&nbsp; That would be a very delicate business, and
perhaps it would be better to begin with Jasper, though that
would be delicate too.&nbsp; At any rate one might let him know,
in a friendly spirit, to how much remark he exposed the young
lady&mdash;leaving this revelation to work its way upon
him.&nbsp; Unfortunately I couldn&rsquo;t altogether believe that
the pair were unconscious of the observation and the opinion of
the passengers.&nbsp; They weren&rsquo;t boy and girl; they had a
certain social perspective in their eye.&nbsp; I was meanwhile at
any rate in no possession of the details of that behaviour which
had made them&mdash;according to the version of my good friends
in the saloon&mdash;a scandal to the ship; for though I had taken
due note of them, as will already have been gathered, I had taken
really no such ferocious, or at least such competent, note as
Mrs. Peck.&nbsp; Nevertheless the probability was that they knew
what was thought of them&mdash;what naturally would be&mdash;and
simply didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; That made our heroine out rather
perverse and even rather shameless; and yet somehow if these were
her leanings I didn&rsquo;t dislike her for them.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what strange secret excuses I found for
her.&nbsp; I presently indeed encountered, on the spot, a need
for any I might have at call, since, just as I was on the point
of going below again, after several restless turns
and&mdash;within the limit where smoking was allowed&mdash;as
many puffs at a cigar as I cared for, I became aware of a couple
of figures settled together behind one of the lifeboats that
rested on the deck.&nbsp; They were so placed as to be visible
only to a person going close to the rail and peering a little
sidewise.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I peered, but as I stood a
moment beside the rail my eye was attracted by a dusky object
that protruded beyond the boat and that I saw at a second glance
to be the tail of a lady&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; I bent forward an
instant, but even then I saw very little more; that scarcely
mattered however, as I easily concluded that the persons tucked
away in so snug a corner were Jasper Nettlepoint and Mr.
Porterfield&rsquo;s intended.&nbsp; Tucked away was the odious
right expression, and I deplored the fact so betrayed for the
pitiful bad taste in it.&nbsp; I immediately turned away, and the
next moment found myself face to face with our vessel&rsquo;s
skipper.&nbsp; I had already had some conversation with
him&mdash;he had been so good as to invite me, as he had invited
Mrs. Nettlepoint and her son and the young lady travelling with
them, and also Mrs. Peck, to sit at his table&mdash;and had
observed with pleasure that his seamanship had the grace, not
universal on the Atlantic liners, of a fine-weather manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t waste much time&mdash;your friends in
there,&rdquo; he said, nodding in the direction in which he had
seen me looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well, they haven&rsquo;t much to lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m told
<i>she</i> hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wanted to say something exculpatory, but scarcely knew what
note to strike.&nbsp; I could only look vaguely about me at the
starry darkness and the sea that seemed to sleep.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, with these splendid nights and this perfect air
people are beguiled into late hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we want a bit of a blow,&rdquo; the Captain
said.</p>
<p>I demurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much of one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough to clear the decks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was after all rather dry and he went about his
business.&nbsp; He had made me uneasy, and instead of going below
I took a few turns more.&nbsp; The other walkers dropped off pair
by pair&mdash;they were all men&mdash;till at last I was
alone.&nbsp; Then after a little I quitted the field.&nbsp;
Jasper and his companion were still behind their lifeboat.&nbsp;
Personally I greatly preferred our actual conditions, but as I
went down I found myself vaguely wishing, in the interest of I
scarcely knew what, unless it had been a mere superstitious
delicacy, that we might have half a gale.</p>
<p>Miss Mavis turned out, in sea-phrase, early; for the next
morning I saw her come up only a short time after I had finished
my breakfast, a ceremony over which I contrived not to
dawdle.&nbsp; She was alone and Jasper Nettlepoint, by a rare
accident, was not on deck to help her.&nbsp; I went to meet
her&mdash;she was encumbered as usual with her shawl, her
sun-umbrella and a book&mdash;and laid my hands on her chair,
placing it near the stern of the ship, where she liked best to
be.&nbsp; But I proposed to her to walk a little before she sat
down, and she took my arm after I had put her accessories into
the chair.&nbsp; The deck was clear at that hour and the morning
light gay; one had an extravagant sense of good omens and
propitious airs.&nbsp; I forget what we spoke of first, but it
was because I felt these things pleasantly; and not to torment my
companion nor to test her, that I couldn&rsquo;t help exclaiming
cheerfully after a moment, as I have mentioned having done the
first day: &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re getting on, we&rsquo;re
getting on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I count every hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last days always go quicker,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and the last hours&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the last hours?&rdquo; she asked; for I had
instinctively checked myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh one&rsquo;s so glad then that it&rsquo;s almost the
same as if one had arrived.&nbsp; Yet we ought to be grateful
when the elements have been so kind to us,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll have enjoyed the voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated ever so little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, much more than
I expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think it would be very bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrible, horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of these words was strange, but I hadn&rsquo;t much
time to reflect upon it, for turning round at that moment I saw
Jasper Nettlepoint come toward us.&nbsp; He was still distant by
the expanse of the white deck, and I couldn&rsquo;t help taking
him in from head to foot as he drew nearer.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know what rendered me on this occasion particularly sensitive to
the impression, but it struck me that I saw him as I had never
seen him before, saw him, thanks to the intense sea-light, inside
and out, in his personal, his moral totality.&nbsp; It was a
quick, a vivid revelation; if it only lasted a moment it had a
simplifying certifying effect.&nbsp; He was intrinsically a
pleasing apparition, with his handsome young face and that marked
absence of any drop in his personal arrangements which, more than
any one I&rsquo;ve ever seen, he managed to exhibit on
shipboard.&nbsp; He had none of the appearance of wearing out old
clothes that usually prevails there, but dressed quite straight,
as I heard some one say.&nbsp; This gave him an assured, almost a
triumphant air, as of a young man who would come best out of any
awkwardness.&nbsp; I expected to feel my companion&rsquo;s hand
loosen itself on my arm, as an indication that now she must go to
him, and I was almost surprised she didn&rsquo;t drop me.&nbsp;
We stopped as we met and Jasper bade us a friendly
good-morning.&nbsp; Of course the remark that we had another
lovely day was already indicated, and it led him to exclaim, in
the manner of one to whom criticism came easily, &ldquo;Yes, but
with this sort of thing consider what one of the others would
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the other ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be there now, or at any rate
tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then I&rsquo;m glad it isn&rsquo;t one of the
others&rdquo;&mdash;and I smiled at the young lady on my
arm.&nbsp; My words offered her a chance to say something
appreciative, and gave him one even more; but neither Jasper nor
Grace Mavis took advantage of the occasion.&nbsp; What they did
do, I noticed, was to look at each other rather fixedly an
instant; after which she turned her eyes silently to the
sea.&nbsp; She made no movement and uttered no sound, contriving
to give me the sense that she had all at once become perfectly
passive, that she somehow declined responsibility.&nbsp; We
remained standing there with Jasper in front of us, and if the
contact of her arm didn&rsquo;t suggest I should give her up,
neither did it intimate that we had better pass on.&nbsp; I had
no idea of giving her up, albeit one of the things I seemed to
read just then into Jasper&rsquo;s countenance was a fine
implication that she was his property.&nbsp; His eyes met mine
for a moment, and it was exactly as if he had said to me &ldquo;I
know what you think, but I don&rsquo;t care a rap.&rdquo; What I
really thought was that he was selfish beyond the limits: that
was the substance of my little revelation.&nbsp; Youth is almost
always selfish, just as it is almost always conceited, and, after
all, when it&rsquo;s combined with health and good parts, good
looks and good spirits, it has a right to be, and I easily
forgive it if it be really youth.&nbsp; Still it&rsquo;s a
question of degree, and what stuck out of Jasper
Nettlepoint&mdash;if, of course, one had the intelligence for
it&mdash;was that his egotism had a hardness, his love of his own
way an avidity.&nbsp; These elements were jaunty and prosperous,
they were accustomed to prevail.&nbsp; He was fond, very fond, of
women; they were necessary to him&mdash;that was in his type; but
he wasn&rsquo;t in the least in love with Grace Mavis.&nbsp;
Among the reflexions I quickly made this was the one that was
most to the point.&nbsp; There was a degree of awkwardness, after
a minute, in the way we were planted there, though the
apprehension of it was doubtless not in the least with
himself.&nbsp; To dissimulate my own share in it, at any rate, I
asked him how his mother might be.</p>
<p>His answer was unexpected.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go down
and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till Miss Mavis is tired of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said nothing to this and I made her walk again.&nbsp; For
some minutes she failed to speak; then, rather abruptly, she
began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen you talking to that lady who sits
at our table&mdash;the one who has so many children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Peck?&nbsp; Oh yes, one has inevitably talked with
Mrs. Peck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know her very well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only as one knows people at sea.&nbsp; An acquaintance
makes itself.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t mean very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t speak to me&mdash;she might if she
wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what she says of you&mdash;that you
might speak to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh if she&rsquo;s waiting for that!&rdquo; said my
companion with a laugh.&nbsp; Then she added: &ldquo;She lives in
our street, nearly opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the reason why she thinks
you coy or haughty.&nbsp; She has seen you so often and seems to
know so much about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does she know about me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah you must ask her&mdash;I can&rsquo;t tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what she knows,&rdquo; said my young
lady.&nbsp; After a moment she went on: &ldquo;She must have seen
I ain&rsquo;t very sociable.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, &ldquo;What
are you laughing at?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;my amusement was difficult to
explain&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re not very sociable, and yet
somehow you are.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck is, at any rate, and thought
that ought to make it easy for you to enter into conversation
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care for her conversation&mdash;I know
what it amounts to.&rdquo;&nbsp; I made no reply&mdash;I scarcely
knew what reply to make&mdash;and the girl went on: &ldquo;I know
what she thinks and I know what she says.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still I
was silent, but the next moment I saw my discretion had been
wasted, for Miss Mavis put to me straight: &ldquo;Does she make
out that she knows Mr. Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she only claims she knows a lady who knows
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;Mrs. Jeremie.&nbsp; Mrs.
Jeremie&rsquo;s an idiot!&rdquo;&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t in a
position to controvert this, and presently my young lady said she
would sit down.&nbsp; I left her in her chair&mdash;I saw that
she preferred it&mdash;and wandered to a distance.&nbsp; A few
minutes later I met Jasper again, and he stopped of his own
accord to say: &ldquo;We shall be in about six in the evening of
our eleventh day&mdash;they promise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If nothing happens, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I&rsquo;m
wondering!&rdquo;&nbsp; And I turned away and went below with the
foolish but innocent satisfaction of thinking I had mystified
him.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">don&rsquo;t</span> know what to
do, and you must help me,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint said to me,
that evening, as soon as I looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been crying here and going on&mdash;she has
quite upset me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crying?&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t look like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and that&rsquo;s what startled me.&nbsp; She
came in to see me this afternoon, as she has done before, and we
talked of the weather and the run of the ship and the manners of
the stewardess and other such trifles, and then suddenly, in the
midst of it, as she sat there, on no visible pretext, she burst
into tears.&nbsp; I asked her what ailed her and tried to comfort
her, but she didn&rsquo;t explain; she said it was nothing, the
effect of the sea, of the monotony, of the excitement, of leaving
home.&nbsp; I asked her if it had anything to do with her
prospects, with her marriage; whether she finds as this draws
near that her heart isn&rsquo;t in it.&nbsp; I told her she
mustn&rsquo;t be nervous, that I could enter into that&mdash;in
short I said what I could.&nbsp; All she replied was that she
<i>is</i> nervous, very nervous, but that it was already over;
and then she jumped up and kissed me and went away.&nbsp; Does
she look as if she has been crying?&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint wound
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell, when she never quits that horrid
veil?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as if she were ashamed to show her
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s keeping it for Liverpool.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t like such incidents,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Nettlepoint.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I ought to go above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that where you want me to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh with your arm and that sort of thing, yes.&nbsp; But
I may have to look to you for something more.&nbsp; I feel as if
something were going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I said to Jasper this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He only looked innocent&mdash;as if he thought I meant
a fog or a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t that!&nbsp; I shall
never be good-natured again,&rdquo; Mrs. Nettlepoint went on;
&ldquo;never have a girl put on me that way.&nbsp; You always pay
for it&mdash;there are always tiresome complications.&nbsp; What
I&rsquo;m afraid of is after we get there.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll
throw up her engagement; there will be dreadful scenes; I shall
be mixed up with them and have to look after her and keep her
with me.&nbsp; I shall have to stay there with her till she can
be sent back, or even take her up to London.&nbsp; Do you see all
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I listened respectfully; after which I observed:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re afraid of your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also had a pause.&nbsp; &ldquo;It depends on how you mean
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are things you might say to him&mdash;and with
your manner; because you have one, you know, when you
choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely, but what&rsquo;s my manner to his?&nbsp;
Besides, I <i>have</i> said everything to him.&nbsp; That is
I&rsquo;ve said the great thing&mdash;that he&rsquo;s making her
immensely talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course in answer to that he has asked you how
you know, and you&rsquo;ve told him you have it from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to tell him; and he says it&rsquo;s none
of your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d say that,&rdquo; I remarked,
&ldquo;to my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do so perfectly if you give him a
chance.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s where you can help me.&nbsp; Quarrel
with him&mdash;he&rsquo;s rather good at a quarrel; and that will
divert him and draw him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m ready,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;to
discuss the matter with him for the rest of the
voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I count on you.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;ll ask
you, as he asks me, what the deuce you want him to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go to bed!&rdquo;&mdash;and I&rsquo;m afraid I
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it isn&rsquo;t a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be irritating, but I made my
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly what I told you at
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but don&rsquo;t exult; I hate people who
exult.&nbsp; Jasper asks of me,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;why he
should mind her being talked about if she doesn&rsquo;t mind it
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him why,&rdquo; I replied; and Mrs.
Nettlepoint said she should be exceedingly obliged to me and
repeated that she would indeed take the field.</p>
<p>I looked for Jasper above that same evening, but circumstances
didn&rsquo;t favour my quest.&nbsp; I found him&mdash;that is I
gathered he was again ensconced behind the lifeboat with Miss
Mavis; but there was a needless violence in breaking into their
communion, and I put off our interview till the next day.&nbsp;
Then I took the first opportunity, at breakfast, to make sure of
it.&nbsp; He was in the saloon when I went in and was preparing
to leave the table; but I stopped him and asked if he would give
me a quarter of an hour on deck a little later&mdash;there was
something particular I wanted to say to him.&nbsp; He said
&ldquo;Oh yes, if you like&rdquo;&mdash;with just a visible
surprise, but I thought with plenty of assurance.&nbsp; When I
had finished my breakfast I found him smoking on the forward-deck
and I immediately began: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to say something
you won&rsquo;t at all like; to ask you a question you&rsquo;ll
probably denounce for impertinent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall if I find it so,&rdquo; said Jasper
Nettlepoint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course my warning has meant that I don&rsquo;t
care if you do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a good deal older than you and
I&rsquo;m a friend&mdash;of many years&mdash;of your
mother.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing I like less than to be
meddlesome, but I think these things give me a certain
right&mdash;a sort of privilege.&nbsp; Besides which my inquiry
will speak for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so many damned preliminaries?&rdquo; my young man
asked through his smoke.</p>
<p>We looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes a moment.&nbsp; What
indeed was his mother&rsquo;s manner&mdash;her best
manner&mdash;compared with his?&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you prepared to
be responsible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear no&mdash;to the young lady herself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m speaking of course of Miss Mavis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, my mother tells me you have her greatly on your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So has your mother herself&mdash;now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so good as to say so&mdash;to oblige
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d oblige me a great deal more by reassuring
me.&nbsp; I know perfectly of your knowing I&rsquo;ve told her
that Miss Mavis is greatly talked about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what on earth does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters as a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sign of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she&rsquo;s in a false position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper puffed his cigar with his eyes on the horizon, and I
had, a little unexpectedly, the sense of producing a certain
effect on him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s
<i>your</i> business, what you&rsquo;re attempting to discuss but
it really strikes me it&rsquo;s none of mine.&nbsp; What have I
to do with the tattle with which a pack of old women console
themselves for not being sea-sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call it tattle that Miss Mavis is in love with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drivelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I retorted, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re very
ungrateful.&nbsp; The tattle of a pack of old women has this
importance, that she suspects, or she knows, it exists, and that
decent girls are for the most part very sensitive to that sort of
thing.&nbsp; To be prepared not to heed it in this case she must
have a reason, and the reason must be the one I&rsquo;ve taken
the liberty to call your attention to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In love with me in six days, just like
that?&rdquo;&mdash;and he still looked away through narrowed
eyelids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes, and six days at
sea are equivalent to sixty on land.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to
make you too proud.&nbsp; Of course if you recognise your
responsibility it&rsquo;s all right and I&rsquo;ve nothing to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you mean,&rdquo; he presently
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you ought to have thought of that by this
time.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s engaged to be married, and the gentleman
she&rsquo;s engaged to is to meet her at Liverpool.&nbsp; The
whole ship knows it&mdash;though <i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t tell
them!&mdash;and the whole ship&rsquo;s watching her.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s impertinent if you like, just as I am myself, but we
make a little world here together and we can&rsquo;t blink its
conditions.&nbsp; What I ask you is whether you&rsquo;re prepared
to allow her to give up the gentleman I&rsquo;ve just mentioned
for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper spoke in a moment as if he didn&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; &ldquo;For my sake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To marry her if she breaks with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his eyes from the horizon to my own, and I found a
strange expression in them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has Miss Mavis
commissioned you to go into that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, I don&rsquo;t quite see&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as from another I make it.&nbsp; Let it
come from yourself&mdash;<i>to</i> yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, you must think I lead myself a life!&rdquo; he
cried as in compassion for my simplicity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a question the young lady may put to me any
moment it pleases her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me then express the hope that she will.&nbsp; But
what will you answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, it seems to me that in spite of all the
titles you&rsquo;ve enumerated you&rsquo;ve no reason to expect
I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He turned away, and I dedicated
in perfect sincerity a deep sore sigh to the thought of our young
woman.&nbsp; At this, under the impression of it, he faced me
again and, looking at me from head to foot, demanded: &ldquo;What
is it you want me to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put it to your mother that you ought to go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better do that yourself!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>This time he walked off, and I reflected rather dolefully that
the only clear result of my undertaking would probably have been
to make it vivid to him that she was in love with him.&nbsp; Mrs.
Nettlepoint came up as she had announced, but the day was half
over: it was nearly three o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; She was
accompanied by her son, who established her on deck, arranged her
chair and her shawls, saw she was protected from sun and wind,
and for an hour was very properly attentive.&nbsp; While this
went on Grace Mavis was not visible, nor did she reappear during
the whole afternoon.&nbsp; I hadn&rsquo;t observed that she had
as yet been absent from the deck for so long a period.&nbsp;
Jasper left his mother, but came back at intervals to see how she
got on, and when she asked where Miss Mavis might be answered
that he hadn&rsquo;t the least idea.&nbsp; I sat with my friend
at her particular request: she told me she knew that if I
didn&rsquo;t Mrs. Peck and Mrs. Gotch would make their approach,
so that I must act as a watch-dog.&nbsp; She was flurried and
fatigued with her migration, and I think that Grace Mavis&rsquo;s
choosing this occasion for retirement suggested to her a little
that she had been made a fool of.&nbsp; She remarked that the
girl&rsquo;s not being there showed her for the barbarian she
only could be, and that she herself was really very good so to
have put herself out; her charge was a mere bore: that was the
end of it.&nbsp; I could see that my companion&rsquo;s advent
quickened the speculative activity of the other ladies they
watched her from the opposite side of the deck, keeping their
eyes fixed on her very much as the man at the wheel kept his on
the course of the ship.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck plainly had designs, and
it was from this danger that Mrs. Nettlepoint averted her
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as we said,&rdquo; she remarked to me
as we sat there.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the buckets in the
well.&nbsp; When I come up everything else goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not at all everything else&mdash;since Jasper
remains here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remains?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He comes and goes&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He goes more than he comes.&nbsp; But <i>n&rsquo;en
parlons plus</i>; I haven&rsquo;t gained anything.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t admire the sea at all&mdash;what is it but a
magnified water-tank?&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t come up
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve an idea she&rsquo;ll stay in her cabin
now,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She tells me she has one to
herself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Nettlepoint replied that she might do
as she liked, and I repeated to her the little conversation I had
had with Jasper.</p>
<p>She listened with interest, but &ldquo;Marry her?&nbsp;
Mercy!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like the fine freedom
with which you give my son away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t accept that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t understand your position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, I <i>have</i> none!&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
a position to be tired of the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t accept it even in the case I put to
him&mdash;that of her believing she had been encouraged to throw
over poor Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even&mdash;not even.&nbsp; Who can know what she
believes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It brought me back to where we had started from.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you do exactly what I said you would&mdash;you show
me a fine example of maternal immorality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maternal fiddlesticks!&nbsp; It was she who began
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you come up today?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep you quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s dinner was served on deck, but I went
into the saloon.&nbsp; Jasper was there, but not Grace Mavis, as
I had half-expected.&nbsp; I sought to learn from him what had
become of her, if she were ill&mdash;he must have thought I had
an odious pertinacity&mdash;and he replied that he knew nothing
whatever about her.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck talked to me&mdash;or tried
to&mdash;of Mrs. Nettlepoint, expatiating on the great interest
it had been to see her; only it was a pity she didn&rsquo;t seem
more sociable.&nbsp; To this I made answer that she was to be
excused on the score of health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say she&rsquo;s sick on this
pond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s unwell in another way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I know the way!&rdquo; Mrs. Peck laughed.&nbsp;
And then she added: &ldquo;I suppose she came up to look after
her pet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her pet?&rdquo; I set my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Miss Mavis.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve talked enough about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite enough.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what that has
had to do with it.&nbsp; Miss Mavis, so far as I&rsquo;ve
noticed, hasn&rsquo;t been above today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it goes on all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be a
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t comforting, but I didn&rsquo;t repeat it on
deck.&nbsp; Mrs. Nettlepoint returned early to her cabin,
professing herself infinitely spent.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know
what &ldquo;went on,&rdquo; but Grace Mavis continued not to
show.&nbsp; I looked in late, for a good-night to my friend, and
learned from her that the girl hadn&rsquo;t been to her.&nbsp;
She had sent the stewardess to her room for news, to see if she
were ill and needed assistance, and the stewardess had come back
with mere mention of her not being there.&nbsp; I went above
after this; the night was not quite so fair and the deck almost
empty.&nbsp; In a moment Jasper Nettlepoint and our young lady
moved past me together.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re
better!&rdquo;&nbsp; I called after her; and she tossed me over
her shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes, I had a headache; but the air
now does me good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went down again&mdash;I was the only person there but they,
and I wanted not to seem to dog their steps&mdash;and, returning
to Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s room, found (her door was open to the
little passage) that she was still sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s on the deck with Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good lady looked up at me from her book.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know you called that all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s better than something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than what else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I was a little afraid of.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Nettlepoint continued to look at me; she asked again what that
might be.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we&rsquo;re
ashore,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>The next day I waited on her at the usual hour of my morning
visit, and found her not a little distraught.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
scenes have begun,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you know I told you I
shouldn&rsquo;t get through without them!&nbsp; You made me
nervous last night&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea what you
meant; but you made me horribly nervous.&nbsp; She came in to see
me an hour ago, and I had the courage to say to her: &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know why I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you frankly that
I&rsquo;ve been scolding my son about you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course
she asked what I meant by that, and I let her know.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It seems to me he drags you about the ship too much for a
girl in your position.&nbsp; He has the air of not remembering
that you belong to some one else.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a want of
taste and even a want of respect in it.&rsquo;&nbsp; That brought
on an outbreak: she became very violent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean indignant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indignant, and above all flustered and
excited&mdash;at my presuming to suppose her relations with my
son not the very simplest in the world.&nbsp; I might scold him
as much as I liked&mdash;that was between ourselves; but she
didn&rsquo;t see why I should mention such matters to
herself.&nbsp; Did I think she allowed him to treat her with
disrespect?&nbsp; That idea wasn&rsquo;t much of a compliment to
either of them!&nbsp; He had treated her better and been kinder
to her than most other people&mdash;there were very few on the
ship who hadn&rsquo;t been insulting.&nbsp; She should be glad
enough when she got off it, to her own people, to some one whom
nobody would have a right to speak of.&nbsp; What was there in
her position that wasn&rsquo;t perfectly natural? what was the
idea of making a fuss about her position?&nbsp; Did I mean that
she took it too easily&mdash;that she didn&rsquo;t think as much
as she ought about Mr. Porterfield?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I believe
she was attached to him&mdash;didn&rsquo;t I believe she was just
counting the hours till she saw him?&nbsp; That would be the
happiest moment of her life.&nbsp; It showed how little I knew
her if I thought anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that must have been rather fine&mdash;I should have
liked to hear it,&rdquo; I said after quite hanging on my
friend&rsquo;s lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what did you
reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I grovelled; I assured her that I accused
her&mdash;as regards my son&mdash;of nothing worse than an excess
of good nature.&nbsp; She helped him to pass his time&mdash;he
ought to be immensely obliged.&nbsp; Also that it would be a very
happy moment for me too when I should hand her over to Mr.
Porterfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you come up today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No indeed&mdash;I think she&rsquo;ll do beautifully
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heaved this time a sigh of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;All&rsquo;s
well that ends well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jasper spent that day a great deal of time with his
mother.&nbsp; She had told me how much she had lacked hitherto
proper opportunity to talk over with him their movements after
disembarking.&nbsp; Everything changes a little the last two or
three days of a voyage; the spell is broken and new combinations
take place.&nbsp; Grace Mavis was neither on deck nor at dinner,
and I drew Mrs. Peck&rsquo;s attention to the extreme propriety
with which she now conducted herself.&nbsp; She had spent the day
in meditation and judged it best to continue to meditate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah she&rsquo;s afraid,&rdquo; said my implacable
neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that we&rsquo;ll tell tales when we get
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean by &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there are plenty&mdash;on a ship like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;we
won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we won&rsquo;t have the chance,&rdquo; said the
dreadful little woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh at that moment&rdquo;&mdash;I spoke from a full
experience&mdash;&ldquo;universal geniality reigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Peck however knew little of any such law.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
guess she&rsquo;s afraid all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;so much the better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the next day too the girl remained invisible, and Mrs.
Nettlepoint told me she hadn&rsquo;t looked in.&nbsp; She herself
had accordingly inquired by the stewardess if she might be
received in Miss Mavis&rsquo;s own quarters, and the young lady
had replied that they were littered up with things and unfit for
visitors: she was packing a trunk over.&nbsp; Jasper made up for
his devotion to his mother the day before by now spending a great
deal of his time in the smoking-room.&nbsp; I wanted to say to
him &ldquo;This is much better,&rdquo; but I thought it wiser to
hold my tongue.&nbsp; Indeed I had begun to feel the emotion of
prospective arrival&mdash;the sense of the return to Europe
always kept its intensity&mdash;and had thereby the less
attention for other matters.&nbsp; It will doubtless appear to
the critical reader that my expenditure of interest had been out
of proportion to the vulgar appearances of which my story gives
an account, but to this I can only reply that the event was to
justify me.&nbsp; We sighted land, the dim yet rich coast of
Ireland, about sunset, and I leaned on the bulwark and took it
in.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like much, does it?&rdquo;
I heard a voice say, beside me; whereupon, turning, I found Grace
Mavis at hand.&nbsp; Almost for the first time she had her veil
up, and I thought her very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be more tomorrow,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, a great deal more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first sight of land, at sea, changes
everything,&rdquo; I went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It always affects me
as waking up from a dream.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a return to
reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she made me no response; then she said &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t look very real yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and meanwhile, this lovely evening, one can put it
that the dream&rsquo;s still present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky, which had a brightness, though the
light of the sun had left it and that of the stars hadn&rsquo;t
begun.&nbsp; &ldquo;It <i>is</i> a lovely evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, with this we shall do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood some moments more, while the growing dusk effaced
the line of the land more rapidly than our progress made it
distinct.&nbsp; She said nothing more, she only looked in front
of her; but her very quietness prompted me to something
suggestive of sympathy and service.&nbsp; It was difficult indeed
to strike the right note&mdash;some things seemed too wide of the
mark and others too importunate.&nbsp; At last, unexpectedly, she
appeared to give me my chance.&nbsp; Irrelevantly, abruptly she
broke out: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me you knew Mr.
Porterfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, yes&mdash;I used to see him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
often wanted to speak to you of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her face on me and in the deepened evening I
imagined her more pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;What good would that
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why it would be a pleasure,&rdquo; I replied rather
foolishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;call it that,&rdquo; I smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know him so well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My smile became a laugh and I lost a little my
confidence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not easy to make speeches
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate speeches!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words came from her
lips with a force that surprised me; they were loud and
hard.&nbsp; But before I had time to wonder she went on a little
differently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall you know him when you see
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, I think.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her manner was so
strange that I had to notice it in some way, and I judged the
best way was jocularly; so I added: &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh perhaps you&rsquo;ll point him out!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she walked quickly away.&nbsp; As I looked after her there came
to me a perverse, rather a provoking consciousness of having
during the previous days, and especially in speaking to Jasper
Nettlepoint, interfered with her situation in some degree to her
loss.&nbsp; There was an odd pang for me in seeing her move about
alone; I felt somehow responsible for it and asked myself why I
couldn&rsquo;t have kept my hands off.&nbsp; I had seen Jasper in
the smoking-room more than once that day, as I passed it, and
half an hour before this had observed, through the open door,
that he was there.&nbsp; He had been with her so much that
without him she now struck one as bereaved and forsaken.&nbsp;
This was really better, no doubt, but superficially it
moved&mdash;and I admit with the last
inconsequence&mdash;one&rsquo;s pity.&nbsp; Mrs. Peck would
doubtless have assured me that their separation was gammon: they
didn&rsquo;t show together on deck and in the saloon, but they
made it up elsewhere.&nbsp; The secret places on shipboard are
not numerous; Mrs. Peck&rsquo;s &ldquo;elsewhere&rdquo; would
have been vague, and I know not what licence her imagination
took.&nbsp; It was distinct that Jasper had fallen off, but of
course what had passed between them on this score wasn&rsquo;t so
and could never be.&nbsp; Later on, through his mother, I had
<i>his</i> version of that, but I may remark that I gave it no
credit.&nbsp; Poor Mrs. Nettlepoint, on the other hand, was of
course to give it all.&nbsp; I was almost capable, after the girl
had left me, of going to my young man and saying: &ldquo;After
all, do return to her a little, just till we get in!&nbsp; It
won&rsquo;t make any difference after we land.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I
don&rsquo;t think it was the fear he would tell me I was an idiot
that prevented me.&nbsp; At any rate the next time I passed the
door of the smoking-room I saw he had left it.&nbsp; I paid my
usual visit to Mrs. Nettlepoint that night, but I troubled her no
further about Miss Mavis.&nbsp; She had made up her mind that
everything was smooth and settled now, and it seemed to me I had
worried her, and that she had worried herself, in
sufficiency.&nbsp; I left her to enjoy the deepening foretaste of
arrival, which had taken possession of her mind.&nbsp; Before
turning in I went above and found more passengers on deck than I
had ever seen so late.&nbsp; Jasper moved about among them alone,
but I forbore to join him.&nbsp; The coast of Ireland had
disappeared, but the night and the sea were perfect.&nbsp; On the
way to my cabin, when I came down, I met the stewardess in one of
the passages, and the idea entered my head to say to her:
&ldquo;Do you happen to know where Miss Mavis is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she&rsquo;s in her room, sir, at this
hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I could speak to her?&rdquo;&nbsp; It
had come into my mind to ask her why she had wanted to know of me
if I should recognise Mr. Porterfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sir,&rdquo; said the stewardess; &ldquo;she has gone
to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I followed the
young lady&rsquo;s excellent example.</p>
<p>The next morning, while I dressed, the steward of my side of
the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted.&nbsp; But the
first thing he said to, me was: &ldquo;Rather a bad job,
sir&mdash;a passenger missing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while I took I
scarce know what instant chill from it, &ldquo;A lady,
sir,&rdquo; he went on&mdash;&ldquo;whom I think you knew.&nbsp;
Poor Miss Mavis, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Missing</i>?&rdquo; I cried&mdash;staring at him and
horror-stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not on the ship.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t
find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where to God is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I recall his queer face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well sir, I suppose you
know that as well as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean she has jumped overboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time in the night, sir&mdash;on the quiet.&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s beyond every one, the way she escaped
notice.&nbsp; They usually sees &rsquo;em, sir.&nbsp; It must
have been about half-past two.&nbsp; Lord, but she was sharp,
sir.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t so much as make a splash.&nbsp; They
say she <i>&rsquo;ad</i> come against her will, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had dropped upon my sofa&mdash;I felt faint.&nbsp; The man
went on, liking to talk as persons of his class do when they have
something horrible to tell.&nbsp; She usually rang for the
stewardess early, but this morning of course there had been no
ring.&nbsp; The stewardess had gone in all the same about eight
o&rsquo;clock and found the cabin empty.&nbsp; That was about an
hour previous.&nbsp; Her things were there in confusion&mdash;the
things she usually wore when she went above.&nbsp; The stewardess
thought she had been a bit odd the night before, but had waited a
little and then gone back.&nbsp; Miss Mavis hadn&rsquo;t turned
up&mdash;and she didn&rsquo;t turn up.&nbsp; The stewardess began
to look for her&mdash;she hadn&rsquo;t been seen on deck or in
the saloon.&nbsp; Besides, she wasn&rsquo;t dressed&mdash;not to
show herself; all her clothes were in her room.&nbsp; There was
another lady, an old lady, Mrs. Nettlepoint&mdash;I would know
her&mdash;that she was sometimes with, but the stewardess had
been with <i>her</i> and knew Miss Mavis hadn&rsquo;t come near
her that morning.&nbsp; She had spoken to <i>him</i> and they had
taken a quiet look&mdash;they had hunted everywhere.&nbsp; A
ship&rsquo;s a big place, but you did come to the end of it, and
if a person wasn&rsquo;t there why there it was.&nbsp; In short
an hour had passed and the young lady was not accounted for: from
which I might judge if she ever would be.&nbsp; The watch
couldn&rsquo;t account for her, but no doubt the fishes in the
sea could&mdash;poor miserable pitiful lady!&nbsp; The stewardess
and he had of course thought it their duty to speak at once to
the Doctor, and the Doctor had spoken immediately to the
Captain.&nbsp; The Captain didn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;they never
did, but he&rsquo;d try to keep it quiet&mdash;they always
did.</p>
<p>By the time I succeeded in pulling myself together and getting
on, after a fashion, the rest of my clothes I had learned that
Mrs. Nettlepoint wouldn&rsquo;t yet have been told, unless the
stewardess had broken it to her within the previous few
minutes.&nbsp; Her son knew, the young gentleman on the other
side of the ship&mdash;he had the other steward; my man had seen
him come out of his cabin and rush above, just before he came in
to me.&nbsp; He <i>had</i> gone above, my man was sure; he
hadn&rsquo;t gone to the old lady&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; I catch
again the sense of my dreadfully seeing something at that moment,
catch the wild flash, under the steward&rsquo;s words, of Jasper
Nettlepoint leaping, with a mad compunction in his young agility,
over the side of the ship.&nbsp; I hasten to add, however, that
no such incident was destined to contribute its horror to poor
Grace Mavis&rsquo;s unwitnessed and unlighted tragic act.&nbsp;
What followed was miserable enough, but I can only glance at
it.&nbsp; When I got to Mrs. Nettlepoint&rsquo;s door she was
there with a shawl about her; the stewardess had just told her
and she was dashing out to come to me.&nbsp; I made her go
back&mdash;I said I would go for Jasper.&nbsp; I went for him but
I missed him, partly no doubt because it was really at first the
Captain I was after.&nbsp; I found this personage and found him
highly scandalised, but he gave me no hope that we were in error,
and his displeasure, expressed with seamanlike strength, was a
definite settlement of the question.&nbsp; From the deck, where I
merely turned round and looked, I saw the light of another summer
day, the coast of Ireland green and near and the sea of a more
charming colour than it had shown at all.&nbsp; When I came below
again Jasper had passed back; he had gone to his cabin and his
mother had joined him there.&nbsp; He remained there till we
reached Liverpool&mdash;I never saw him.&nbsp; His mother, after
a little, at his request, left him alone.&nbsp; All the world
went above to look at the land and chatter about our tragedy, but
the poor lady spent the day, dismally enough, in her room.&nbsp;
It seemed to me, the dreadful day, intolerably long; I was
thinking so of vague, of inconceivable yet inevitable
Porterfield, and of my having to face him somehow on the
morrow.&nbsp; Now of course I knew why she had asked me if I
should recognise him; she had delegated to me mentally a certain
pleasant office.&nbsp; I gave Mrs. Peck and Mrs. Gotch a wide
berth&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t talk to them.&nbsp; I could, or at
least I did a little, to Mrs. Nettlepoint, but with too many
reserves for comfort on either side, since I quite felt how
little it would now make for ease to mention Jasper to her.&nbsp;
I was obliged to assume by my silence that he had had nothing to
do with what had happened; and of course I never really
ascertained what he <i>had</i> had to do.&nbsp; The secret of
what passed between him and the strange girl who would have
sacrificed her marriage to him on so short an acquaintance
remains shut up in his breast.&nbsp; His mother, I know, went to
his door from time to time, but he refused her admission.&nbsp;
That evening, to be human at a venture, I requested the steward
to go in and ask him if he should care to see me, and the good
man returned with an answer which he candidly transmitted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo;&mdash;Jasper apparently was
almost as scandalised as the Captain.</p>
<p>At Liverpool, at the dock, when we had touched, twenty people
came on board and I had already made out Mr. Porterfield at a
distance.&nbsp; He was looking up at the side of the great vessel
with disappointment written&mdash;for my strained eyes&mdash;in
his face; disappointment at not seeing the woman he had so long
awaited lean over it and wave her handkerchief to him.&nbsp;
Every one was looking at him, every one but she&mdash;his
identity flew about in a moment&mdash;and I wondered if it
didn&rsquo;t strike him.&nbsp; He used to be gaunt and angular,
but had grown almost fat and stooped a little.&nbsp; The interval
between us diminished&mdash;he was on the plank and then on the
deck with the jostling agents of the Customs; too soon for my
equanimity.&nbsp; I met him instantly, however, to save him from
exposure&mdash;laid my hand on him and drew him away, though I
was sure he had no impression of having seen me before.&nbsp; It
was not till afterwards that I thought this rather
characteristically dull of him.&nbsp; I drew him far away&mdash;I
was conscious of Mrs. Peck and Mrs. Gotch, looking at us as we
passed&mdash;into the empty stale smoking-room: he remained
speechless, and that struck me as like him.&nbsp; I had to speak
first, he couldn&rsquo;t even relieve me by saying &ldquo;Is
anything the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; I broke ground by putting it,
feebly, that she was ill.&nbsp; It was a dire moment.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
