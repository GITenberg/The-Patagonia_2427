description: The Patagonia was slow, but spacious and comfortable, and there was a
  motherly decency in her long nursing rock and her rustling old- fashioned gait,
  the multitudinous swish, in her wake, as of a thousand proper petticoats. It was
  as if she wished not to present herself in port with the splashed eagerness of a
  young creature.
